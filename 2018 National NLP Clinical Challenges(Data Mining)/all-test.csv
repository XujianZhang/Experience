Mr. Geiger is a 74 year old man who comes in today for follow up of his 
blood pressure medication as well as his cholesterol level.  I have been 
readjusting Mr. Geiger's blood pressure regimen since he left Hale Memorial Hospital for an episode of gastroenteritis and hypovolemia 
several months ago.  His blood pressure regimen currently is HCTZ 25mg 
q.d., lisinopril, 20mg q.d. and atenolol 25mg q.d.  He apparently went 
to an office visit at Dr. Mueller office a week ago and was noted there 
to have high blood pressure.  She prescribed an increase in his atenolol 
from 25mg to 50mg.  He has not yet completed that prescription.  Mr. 
Geiger's blood pressure today is 180/80.  He denies any recent chest 
pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness or other symptoms.  

Mr. Geiger's cholesterol was checked by me last visit due to a modestly 
elevated cholesterol one year ago which had not been treated.  His 
current cholesterol level was total 283, HDL 54, LDL 196.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Mr. Geiger denies any recent fever, chills, 
headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, dysuria.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 180/80.  His weight is 184.  
His heart rate is 80.  Lung exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  
The cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1, S2, no 
murmurs.  Abdominal exam is benign.  Extremities show no evidence of 
edema.  

Recent laboratories show a chem 7 panel of sodium 141, potassium 4.5, 
chloride 101, bicarb 29, BUN 11, creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  He has a 
normal liver function test and normal calcium and magnesium.  His T4 is 
normal at 10.3.  His THBR is normal at 0.98.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  
1.   Hypertension.  Mr. Geiger's blood pressure continues to be elevated 
     despite his current regimen of HCTZ and lisinopril and atenolol.  
     He was recently given an increased atenolol dose from Dr. Mueller.  
     I agree with this decision and will wait for him to fill his 
     prescription and begin this new regimen before he follows up in a 
     few weeks for blood pressure check.  
2.   Cholesterol.  The patient's cholesterol is significantly elevated.  
     Given his comorbidities, I would aim for an LDL level less than 
     130.  Thus, I will begin a course of atorvastatin.  His current 
     liver function tests are normal.

3.   Health maintenance.  I have recommended to him losing some weight.  
     He has gained 6 pounds since his visits last month.  He attributes 
     this to his holiday eating, but he says that he gets a good deal of 
     exercise.  I will continue to recommend diet and exercise for him.  
     He has most recently competed a Pneumovax and a flu vaccine last 
     week.

Mr. Geiger is a 75 year old man with a history of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia and panhypopituitarism who comes in today for 
follow up of his blood pressure.  We have been titrating up his 
blood pressure meds over the past week.  He is gone from 50mg of 
atenolol to 75 to 100mg with steady improvement in his blood 
pressure.  His current regimen is atenolol 100q.d., HCTZ 25 q.d., 
lisinopril 20mg q.d.  The patient has had no dizziness or other 
symptoms with increasing doses of atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 160/94.  Heart rate 
is 64.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Lungs clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  Cardiac exam: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, 
S2 with no murmurs.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities: no edema.  

Laboratories:  Cholesterol from June 11, 2077: total 171, HDL 57, 
LDL 86. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Geiger is a very pleasant 75 year old 
man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
1. 	Hypertension.  Blood pressure still elevated.  I will increase 
lisinopril to 30mg q.d.  Will also check a set of electrolytes 
at his next visit in 2 weeks when his blood pressure will be 
followed up.
2. 	Cholesterol.  Well controlled at this time.
3. 	Health maintenance.  The patient denies any colonoscopy in the 
past.  I do not see one on record or in his history.  We will 
arrange a screening colonoscopy.  The patient has had recent 
PSA of 2.8 and a normal prostate exam by me last year.  He is 
due for annual physical next month and will schedule this.

null                                           03/13/79


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a known history of
hypopituitarism and hypertension who comes in today for routine
annual exam.  He states that he has been feeling exceptionally
well.  No history of chest pain, angina, dyspnea on exertion,
shortness of breath, abdominal complaints.  No difficulties in
bowel habits, melena, BRBPR.  No prostatic symptoms of urinary
hesitancy or slow stream.  He states that he has been carefully
taking his prednisone and testosterone as prescribed, as well as
his blood pressure medicines including lisinopril 40 q.d.,
atenolol 75 q.d., and his cholesterol medicine 10 of Lipitor q.d.
 He is no longer taking the hydrochlorothiazide that was
prescribed to him in the past.  He also states that he has run
out of Synthroid and has not been taking that for the past
several weeks.

The patient states that he is staying active, getting some
exercise, continues to abstain from smoking or drinking, and has
an appropriate diet.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  On full review of systems, he denies any
current concerns except for occasional difficulty maintaining an
erection, which he states is not a significant problem for him.

MEDICATIONS:  Lipitor 10 q.d., testosterone q.3. weeks,
prednisone 5 mg q.a.m. 2.5 mg q.p.m., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., and 
atenolol 75 mg q.d.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Panhypopituitarism secondary to
macroadenoma resection and hypertension.

HEALTH MAINTENANCE:  Last cholesterol level 06/2077, total 171
with an HDL of 57 and LDL of 86.  The patient has not had a prior
colonoscopy.  Last PSA was less than assay 1 year ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well appearing, in no acute distress. 
Blood pressure elevated at 170/84, heart rate 60.  HEENT:  Pupils
equal, round, reactive to light.  Extraocular movements are
intact.  Fundi are benign.  Oropharynx is clear.  Tympanic
membranes are clear.  Neck:  Shows no lymphadenopathy, no
thyromegaly.  He does have a 3 x 3 cm cyst on his posterior neck
that seems to be a lipoma.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
bruits.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac: 
Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 normal, positive S4, 1/6 systolic
murmur at the apex.  Abdomen:  Midline scar status post some type
of cord resection.  Positive bowel sounds, soft, nontender,
nondistended, no hepatosplenomegaly.  Aorta is nonpalpable. 
There are no renal bruits.  Femoral arteries are without bruits. 
GU:  Testicles appear normal.  Penis appears normal.  Rectal: 
Guaiac negative brown stool.  Prostate is smooth and nonenlarged.
 Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Normal sensation
to vibratory in the feet.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  The patient is a very pleasant 77-year-old
man who is overall doing extremely well except for his
hypertension which is poorly controlled.  I am unclear as to why
he stopped his hydrochlorothiazide, but I think that this should
be restarted as we do not have any further room with his
lisinopril or atenolol.  He will begin at 25 mg q.d.  I will have
his electrolytes checked today and come back and see me in 2
weeks' time for a repeat electrolyte check as well as blood
pressure check, and further medication adjustment if necessary. 
We will also check urinalysis for protein as well as an EKG at
this time given his hypertension.

Hyperlipidemia, on Lipitor.  We will recheck cholesterol today.

Panhypopituitarism.  He seems to be doing well on his medications
except that he stopped his TSH dose for unclear reasons.  I have
instructed him to restart his Synthroid and given him new
prescriptions.  We will recheck thyroid panel at this time.

Health maintenance.  We will check a PSA and schedule a
colonoscopy today.

He will return to clinic in 2 weeks' time for a BP check.

  Urso comes in with several days of:  nausea, diarrhea (5-6 times) with 'everything going through her'.  She has no vomiting. + abd cramping pain.  No blood in the stool.  She had low grade fever.  In addition, she feels increased chest congestion, cough, productive of white sputum.  Her finger sticks at home are running at 280.  No one at home has been sick.

Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology for followup on coronary artery disease.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago and had stenting at that time and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has done well since that time without any exertional angina, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He has been followed here by Dr.  Opal Garner and has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm.  He underwent surgery for hip replacement of his left hip last summer and has recovered from that.  He did get on to about 220 pounds before the surgery, but has gained 20 pounds back and is now at about 240 pounds.  He says that most of this is because of inactivity.  He likes to work in his yard in Barnstable and plans to increase his activity and try and drop off some of that weight this summer.



Past medical history:

   Significant for diabetes, large anteroseptal myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, diverticulosis, tubular adenoma of the colon, and diverticulitis.



Current Medications:

  Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

 Plavix 75 mg qd

 aspirin 325 mg qd

 Prilosec 20 mg qd

 Toprol XL 25 mg qd

 nitroglycerin PRN



Family history:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Social history:

   He is retired.  He lives in Barnstable.  He likes to work in his yard.  He quit smoking several years ago.



Review of systems:

   Unchanged from previous visits.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   66 and regular

-BP: 130/70  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Mildly overweight

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Reveals a normal S1 and S2, with a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

Echocardiogram test STATUS POST His last echo.  which showed an ejection fraction of 52% with some asymmetric septal hypertrophy with upper septal prominence.  There was trace MR and trace TR and the evidence of his apical aneurysm.

Stress test STATUS POST at that time as well as  07/10/2080. He exercised for 4 minutes, got to 44% of his predicted maximum heart rate.  There was no evidence of ischemia.  There was evidence of a previous anteroapical, anteroseptal infarct.



EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, right bundle branch block, and a possible old IMI and old ASMI.



Selected recent labs:

 The patient's last blood work was 08/17/2080 and at that time his BUN was 9, creatinine 0.8, potassium was 3.8, blood glucose 145, cholesterol was 96, triglycerides 70, HDL 42, and LDL 40.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a big anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago.  He has had stenting of his coronaries in 2076.  He is without any evidence of ischemia at this time.  He has a fairly good LV function.  There is an LV aneurysm, but Coumadin has been deferred and he has been treated with aspirin and Plavix.  He is on a good medical regimen.  Blood pressure seems to be well controlled.  He does not have any evidence of severe decompensated congestive heart failure.  He does have some trace pedal edema.  His weight has gone up significantly since the operation for his hip and I have encouraged him to start walking program and try and drop off that weight this summer.  I would like to do CBC, electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, and a CBC with lipids today.  My plan would be keep him on his current regimen and see him back here in another six months to see how he is doing with his weight.  Cholesterol has been in very good shape and I do not expect that to be a problem.

Dear Dr.  Osuna:



  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr.  Nicholas Cortez in my office today in Cardiology at AMC.  As you know, he is a 61-year-old white male who has a history of myocardial infarction approximately six years ago, stenting at that time, and subsequently had another stent placed in 2076.  He has been noted to have an anteroapical aneurysm and when I saw him in October, was having some discomfort which may have been myocardial ischemia and angina.  His blood pressure was elevated, so we added Diovan to control the blood pressure.  He has had some dimunition in the symptoms and the frequency of these symptoms got arrangement for.  Exercise test was also put in place and the exercise results are now available as well as the echocardiography that had been scheduled at that time.  He still has occasional ankle swelling, but is able to walk without discomfort.  He has gained some weight over the summer and is having difficulties staying away from salty foods, particularly he likes pastrami.  He is no longer using a CPAP.



Current Medications:

  aspirin 325 mg qd

 Diovan 80 mg qd

 Imdur 30 mg qd

 Lasix 10 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 lisinopril 40 mg qd

Physical examination:

	

-Pulse:   80 and regular

-BP: 135/90  

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-General:   He is a mildly overweight white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Oriented x 3

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits, have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes

-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has trace pedal edema bilaterally



Procedures:

	

Echocardiogram STATUS POST shows an ejection fraction of 67%.  concentric LVH, mildly dilated left ventricle with regional wall motion abnormalities, trace mitral regurgitation, and trace tricuspid regurgitation.

Stress test STATUS POST nuclear stress test; which showed limited exercise capacity exercising for 5 minutes and 28 seconds.  Imaging showed an ejection fraction of 31%.  Perfusion images showed mild-to-distal anteroapical and septal scars associated with mild distal anterior ischemia.  The apex appeared more aneurysmal than the previous stress test and the LV was more dilated with a decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction from 38 to 31.



	EKG:

    shows normal sinus rhythm, left atrial enlargement, and a right bundle branch block with an old IMI.



	Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a very pleasant 61-year-old gentleman who has a history of a large anteroseptal MI approximately six years ago, had stenting his LAD in 2076, and now has a recurrence of what sounds like possible angina and a positive stress test has a decrease in LV function, increase in LV aneurysmal dilatation, and ischemia in the anterior distribution. There is a discrepancy between the ejection fraction on the echo and I suspect that has to do with differences in technique. I have talked with the patient about cardiac catheterization and I would like to get him in for that as soon as possible so we can assess the degree of coronary disease. Hopefully it is amenable to percutaneous angioplasty, but I am somewhat concerned about the left ventricular aneurysm. We will arrange for cardiac catheterization either next week or the following week and I will plan to see him back here in the office approximately a month which will be after his catheterization and hopeful angioplasty.

SDU ADMISSION NOTE



PATIENT:  XAYAVONG, BRANDON

MRN:  7826250

ADMIT DATE: 6/13/2082

PCP: DR. ERNEST EDGE

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: DR. ASHLEI TYSON

OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGIST: DR. BRIAN MOSS (772-261-4350)



CHIEF COMPLAINT: fatigue, lightheadedness



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w ~3 days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.



He receives most of his care at Duluth Clinic-Hermantown (Dr. Moss).  Two weeks ago, he had BiV/ICD placement, as well as left heart catheterization that showed, per verbal report, &#8220;multivessel disease difficult for CABG.&#8221;  He says he also had a chemical stress study but is unsure of the results.  He reports that he was then referred to GNC for high-risk CABG (Dr. U. Wyatt) and potential heart transplant evaluation (Dr. A. Tyson).  



He feels that since the BiV/ICD placement he has been feeling more tired, specifically in the past 3 days, wherein he reports fatigue, nausea, poor sleep, exertional lightheadedness.  He has not had chest pain (he did have chest pain with prior two MIs), palpitations, vomiting, diarrhea.  He does have some orthopnea, but no PND and LE swelling intermittently, but not at present.  To his knowledge, he has never had a tachyarrhythmia.  However, he does note that he was started on digoxin a few weeks ago, tried it for 1 week, then had fatigue, nausea, GI upset, and that the medication was then discontinued.



On arrival, he had HR 135, BP 106/73 with some drops to low of 80/50.  Felt to be VT versus Afib with aberrancy.  EP was consulted, interrogated his device, and confirmed that he was in Afib (and that it had never fired or detected VT/VF).  He was given amio load 300 and drip at 1mg/min, with some HR response to 100-120s.  For hyperkalemia to 5.1, he was given calcium gluconate, insulin, D50, bicard; and his Mg was repleted.  Given his persistent symptoms, per EP recs, he was started on heparin drip with 5000 units bolus.  (He is not on Coumadin at baseline; he takes toprol XL 12.5mg only.)  CXR by report was clear.  With admiodarone, BPs dropped to 75; upon discontinuation, BPs back up to 80s, then 90s.  Of note, he says his baseline HR is 80s and SBP is 90s.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Xayavong is a 61M h/o CAD (anterior STEMI 2077, stents x2 to LAD, 4 stents since then, last 2080), DM, CHF unknown EF, HTN, who p/w a couple days of nonspecific symptoms of fatigue, nausea, and poor sleep.  He presented with atrial fibrillation with RVR, with moderate response to IV amiodarone load and bolus but hypotension.  He has known multivessel disease felt by report to be a high-risk CABG candidate, and is doubly referred for heart transplant evaluation.



# CV/RHYTHM: Afib/RVR, with generalized nonspecific symptoms

- Not ideally controlled on amiodarone given hypotension, but can tolerate SBP 90s given this is his baseline and no evidence of hypoperfusion

- Trial digoxin low-dose versus cautiously titrating diltiazem or metoprolol

- Bolus NS as needed for low BPs

- High risk for clot given likely prolonged Afib, however, CHADS is 2 or 3 (HTN, DM, ?CHF)

- Heparinize, hold on Coumadin bridge in case of possible procedures

- Tele, replete lytes



# CV/ISCHEMIA: Known multivessel disease, difficult to CABG per OSH cardiologist

- ASA, hold BB/ACEI given hypotention, statin, niacin, check lipids

- Given no clear cause for Afib and comorbid with DM, trend cardiac markers

- Ongoing outpatient eval for CABG 



# CV/PUMP: Unknown EF, mild crackles on exam, taking lasix QOD at home. Relatively euvolemic.

- Continue lasix QOD regimen

- Check TTE for new WMA, worsening cardiomyopathy

- Will discuss plan with Heart Failure service



# DM: Hold glipizide, metofrmin while in house. RISS + FSBG AC/HS



FEN: cardiac



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: home PPI

DVT: on heparin

BOWEL: prn regimen

CCU Admission Note



PATIENT: Brandon Xayavong

MRN: 7826250

DATE: 7/21/83

TIME: 4:00pm

PCP: Ernest Edge, MD

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Ashlei Tyson, MD

CONTACT INFO: Elisha (wife) - 968-774-6381 



REASON FOR ADMISSION

Tailored therapy



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Xayavong is a 62 year old man with a history of CAD (s/p STEMI and multiple stents), CHF (s/p BiV ICD, class D and stage III), DM, and CRI who was admitted for tailored therapy after a routine RHC demonstrated elevated filling pressures.



Mr. Xayavong has a primary cardiologist (Dr. Marshall) in Gloucester and has received much medical care at Oregon City Hospital.  He has been followed by Dr. Ashlei Tyson for the possibility of cardiac transplantation and has intermittently been admitted to GNC.  He was admitted to GNC from 6/13/82 to 6/19/82 after being found to be in atrial fibrillation with hypotension, fatigue, and nausea; this was 2 weeks after the placement of his BiV ICD.  He converted to sinus rhythm after amiodarone was administered, but developed a marked transaminitis.  Due to elevated filling pressures (PCWP 23), he required IV Lasix for diuresis.  He was felt to be a poor candidate for CABG given the degree of heart failure, so transplantation was instead pursued.  He was also admitted to GNC from 11/10/82 through 11/13/82 after again being found with elevated filling pressures after complaining of fatigue (PCWP 37); he received a PA line and required a Lasix drip and IV nitroprusside.  At the time of discharge, his reported dry weight was 206 lbs.



He came for a scheduled right-sided heart catheterization today as he has had increasing complaint of fatigue.  He reports that he has been feeling &#8220;lousy,&#8221; that his appetite has been &#8220;crummy,&#8221; and that he is &#8220;feeling real tired.&#8221;  He feels that these symptoms have been relatively severe but unchanged for the past 2 years.  He denies overt shortness of breath, but essentially fatigues very easily with physical exertion, and has been requiring multiple naps a day.  He states that he has been careful with his diet (both fluid and salt intake) without any changes, and that he has been entirely compliant with his medications.  Of note, his cardiologist attempted to change him from Toprol XL to Coreg several months ago, and that seems to have made him feel worse.  He continues to urinate to his home Lasix dosing.  He denies any sensation of chest pain or chest pressure, and denies chest palpitations or sensation of fluttering; he states clearly that he could tell when his heart was in an abnormal rhythm in 6/72.  He says that his pacemaker was &#8220;checked&#8221; last week and that he was told he didn&#8217;t have any &#8220;episodes.&#8221;  He believes that he has been putting on weight recently, and reports that his baseline weight is ~225 lbs.  He denies recent fevers or chills.  He has no complaint of leg swelling.

Head CT/CTA Head and Neck (Today): 





No evidence for intracranial hemorrhage, masses or large territorial infarction.

Left M1 segment filling defect likely represent a thrombus which is partially occlusive given the opacification of the distal MCA 
branches. This finding correlates with patient's given symptoms.



EKG (Today): 








CXR (Today): Large heart


Assessment
: 
63 year old RH man with history of CAD s/p STEMI 2077 s/p 8 stents including LAD, systolic CHF Class Ia with EF 20% s/p BiV ICD placement, diabetes, on Coumadin and ASA, presenting with history of right arm/leg weakness since this morning.  There have been no other neurological symptoms, and no general symptoms other than some lightheadedness.  Exam is notable for decreased strength in the right upper extremity and proximal lower extremity, without facial involvement.  He has pronator drift on the right, with decreased speed and amplitude of fine finger movements on the right, and orbiting of the LUE around the RUE. He has no sensory findings, and no dysarthria or aphasia.  NIHSS was zero.  CT Brain shows loss of gray-white differentiation in Left MCA territory, with Left M1 clot.  There is reconstitution of flow in his distal MCA distribution.


The most likely mechanism is cardioembolic related to his LVAD.  He will be admitted to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management with the Stroke consult service following.  


Plan: 


- Would agree with admitting to the Cardiac surgery service for optimal LVAD management
- Stroke consult service to follow (pager 90395)
- Head and neck imaging complete; f/u final read
- Repeat Head CT tomorrow AM or if there is any change in neurological exam
- Neuro checks q4 hours
- LVAD needs to be evaluated if possible for thrombus; will consult patient's private cardiologist
- Check baseline TCDs; will further decide whether he needs daily TCD monitoring
- To improve perfusion, maximize his SBP as possible per cardiac function; patient does not appear to be perfusion-dependent at this time
- Continue therapeutic anticoagulation for stroke prevention, currently suspecting small stroke
- Continuous telemetry and pulse oximetry
- ROMI with serial CE q 8h x3, and serial EKGs.

- Keep K&gt;4, Mg&gt;2
- Risk factor assessment: ESR, CRP, HBA1c
- Check blood cultures
- Check chromogenic Factor X level
- PT/OT evaluation
- Hold Glypizide XL: use RISS for sugar control with target blood glucose&lt;130




Thank you for this consult. Please page 90395 with any questions or concerns.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
44M with ESRD on HD presents with N/V.  His symptoms appear to be resolving and this may represent a viral gastroenteritis, as his cardiac enzymes are negative and sugars have been well-controlled since presentation to ED.  He may have an element of diabetic gastroparesis given his medication list.  We will add amylase and lipase to his bloodwork to r/o pancreatitis.  Consider AXR to r/o constipation (normally on lactulose).

Plan:
1.  HD today as per usual schedule and prescription.  Hold Epo given Hct elevated.
2.  Will draw blood Cx x 2, iron studies, 25OH Vitamin D, PTH in HD.
3.  Start Nephrocaps.
4.  CAD risk:  Start ASA 81mg qd.
5.  Polypharmacy:  On multiple antihypertensives at different doses.  Would d/c enalapril and losartan.  Use only lisinopril daily (titrate up as needed), but ask patient to take meds after dialysis on dialysis days.
6.  Social work to see (already informed).

EDVISIT^47646361^JAY, COREY^01/29/65^TOMLIN, THEODORE

The patient was seen on 01/29/2065.  I confirm that I have

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ""Foot infection.""

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 46-year-old man

with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes, blood sugars in the

140s this week, chronic renal insufficiency on hemodialysis

secondary to diabetes who had a bilateral TMA who presents with 3

days of right heel ulcer, discharge and foul smelling order.  No

erythema.  The patient had decreased sensation in bilateral feet

secondary to diabetic neuropathy.  He denies nausea, vomiting,

fevers, abdominal pain, cough, shortness breath, or chest pain. 

The patient is blind and speaks Spanish.  He also has a history

of hypertension.

The rest of the past medical history, social history, family

history, surgical history, review of systems, allergies, and

medications as per the resident's note.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature is 98.2, pulse 78, respiratory

rate 20, blood pressure is 201/104, and saturation 99% on room

air.  General:  No apparent distress, cooperative.  HEENT: 

Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils were bilateral cataract

blindness.  Conjunctivae were clear.  Oral mucosa was moist. 

Neck is supple.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no

wheezes or crackles.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No

murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdominal exam:  Good bowel sounds,

nondistended, nontender, and soft.  Extremity exam:  No ankle

edema, calf tenderness, or asymmetry.  Musculoskeletal

examination:  The patient has bilateral TMA.  Skin exam:  The

patient has dry gauze at soles of his bilateral feet; however, he

has a 1 cm diameter ulceration in the heel of his right foot that

is crusty and has some yellowish discharge on gauze.  It indeed

has foul odor.  It is nontender.  Neurological examination: 

Motor strength 5/5 throughout all extremities.  Sensation

decreased bilateral feet, to the ankles.  Rest of the lower

extremities were intact to light touch and symmetrical.  Vascular

examination 2+ radial and DP pulses.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  A 46-year-old man diabetic with

foul smelling foot ulcer.  Possible diagnoses is cellulitis, soft

tissue infection, or osteomyelitis.  The patient's WBC was 6.2. 

Hematocrit and platelets were normal.  He was slightly dry.  His

BUN was 40.  His creatinine of 7.4; however, it was decreased

from his hemodialysis yesterday.  Sodium was 139, potassium was

5.0.  An x-ray of his foot of the right did not reveal any

osteomyelitis; however, given his four smelling odor and

yellowish discharge on his dressing, we elected to treat him with

3.375 mg of Zosyn.  He also received Tylenol for some pain.  The

patient blood pressure remained high and at one point it was

232/109.  He received 10 mg of hydralazine, 10 mg of labetalol IV

as well as 100 mg of labetalol p.o.  The patient's blood pressure

went down to 140/82 prior to admission.  The patient's primary

care physician was called who agreed with the admission to the

Medical Service.

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Diabetic foot ulcers.

2.  Hypertension.

CC: 
LLQ pain


HPI: 
Mr. Jay is a 48yo with type II DM c/b diabetic retinopathy, ESRD on HD, bilateral TMA, and HTN who presents with LLQ pain x2 days.
Mr. Jay was seen in the ED the day prior to admission with the same complaint of new onset LLQ pain, which was sharp, non radiating, and most painful with inspiration.  He reports that at this time, he has some mild shortness of breath with the onset of the pain, although this was resolved by the time he was seen in the ED.  He did not complain of any chest pain, palpitations or dipahoresis at that time, although he did have some nausea and vomited once in the ED.  Patient is well known to the ED from prior admissions, and at that time his pain was felt to be 2/2 to throacic radiculopathy/neuropathy 2/2 to his diabetes, however acuity of pain, CT abdomen was performed at that time, which did not reveal any acute patholgy to explain his pain.  He was discharged to home at that time with oral pain medication.  Patient reports that pain did not improve, and was not well controlled with oral pain mediations at home, so he re- presented to the ED.  He does not report any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, cough, back pain, or LE swelling.  Patient is anuric and has been attending dialysis per his usual MWF routine.  


On presentation to the ED, patient was afebrile, BP 180s/90s, HR 70s, satting 100% on RA.  He was given IV morphine for his pain, and IV benedryl for nausea (he has had a cyclic vomiting/nausea syndrome on prior admission which has been effectively treated this way).  Patient reported at that time that he had not had a bowel movement in 3 days, and that he normally has one every other day.  Rectal exam did not reveal any stool in the vault, and CT scan from the day prior did not show excessive stool or evidence of obstruction or fecal impaction.  However, patient was given dulcolax PR.  He was admitted to medicine for further evaluation and pain control.

                     BHC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

MARVINYANDELL,GRACE   904-68-07-1              VISIT DATE: 08/06/96

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient is a 68 year old 

woman who is being seen by Dr. Dodd who had what was a syncopal 

episode on the premises.  A code was called when bystanders and 

medics reported she was on the floor, diaphoretic and clammy.  The 

patient drank something and then proceeded to be taken to the 

Emergency Department. 

The patient had a cystoscopy planned for today.  She took her 

medication for her diabetes and presented here with weakness, 

nausea, diaphoresis and felt like she may have passed out.  Her 

other complaint was mild back pain from passing out.  No epigastric 

pain or tenderness and no chest pain.  The patient never had any 

chest pain prior to her event.  She is followed by the United Medical Center East and their input is pending at this point. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a past medical history 

significant for diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and 

migraines. 

MEDICATIONS:  The patient's current medications include Plavix, 

Calan slow release and Glucophage. 

ALLERGIES:  The patient is allergic to intravenous pyelogram dye, 

Percocet, penicillin, cephalosporin and lisinopril. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  HEENT:  Examination is normal.  LUNGS: 

Clear bilaterally.  CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm with no 

murmurs.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal. 

GENERAL:  The patient looks well and has no complaints here. 

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Finger stick in the Emergency Department 

was 160.  Electrocardiogram shows some PR depressions in multiple 

leads.  No significant ST elevations. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Impression is this patient is a 68 

year old female with planned cystoscopy today who passed out on the 

premises.  A code was called overhead.  Bystanders reported that 

the patient was diaphoretic.  They gave her something to drink. 

Her blood sugar here was within normal limits.  The patient has no 

complaints of chest pain or shortness of breath.  She looks well 

but does have PR depressions on electrocardiogram but has no rubs 

or gallops on her electrocardiogram.  The patient was made NPO 

because of her cystoscopy procedure. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES: 

1.  Syncopal episode versus presyncope from the taking of her 

diabetes medicine this morning. 

2.  PR depression on electrocardiogram which appears to be new.  No 

old electrocardiogram to compare.  We need to address the PR 

depressions.  This is possibly pericarditis but it is unlikely.  I 

would think that this more likely ischemia than pericarditis. 

3.  Cardiac ischemia. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient will 

need admission and a formal rule out.  She may even need an 

echocardiogram inpatient.  A full work up is pending.  The 

patient's full disposition is pending and she was signed out to Dr. 

Aleta Nunley at 15:00.

Gibson Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note

PATIENT:  Grace Marvin Yandell
MRN:  8099832
ADMIT DATE:  8/27/02
PCP:  unknown

CC:  tx from Mount San Rafael Hospital

HPI:  80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Mount Hospital following a syncopal event at her neurologist   s office on 7/30/02.  At that time, she c/o dizziness, nausea, and her bp reportedly decreased to 60/40.   As per pt   s family, she initially refused to go to the ED but in the car on the way home became increasingly confused, dizzy, and nauseas and was brought to Rafael Mount ED.

Five weeks ago     prior to her hospital admission - pt   s family reports that during a vacation pt had one episode of seizure like activity for which she was seen in Massachusetts and declared stable and released and a second unwitnessed collapse in alaska where she was brought to a hospital in Anchorage and treated for dehydration.  Upon return from vacation, and daughter recalls that she had cough and cold sxs at the time, c/o increasing weakness, backpain, and fevers.  During the same time, the patient reports that she was being weaned off her seizure medications and other medications that might adversely affect her LFTs secondary to LFT elevation on laboratory exams.

At present, pt. c/o severe(10/10) upper back pain and mid-sternal CP (8/10) that seems fixed to her back pain improved with pain medications and worse with movement.  She reports that she is short of breath all the time and has been coughing a thick mucous.  

Hospital Course: 
MRSA Bacteremia:  Blood cultures at San Rafael Hospital grew S. aureus and pt. was started on IV vancomycin.  The bacteremic source remains unclear.  TTE on 8/01/02 showed an EF of 60-65%, no evidence of endocarditis reported.  A TEE on 8/7/02 visualezed all the valves and no vegetations were seen.  Her R. knee was tapped on 8/8/02 and cultures were negative.  A bone scan on 7/7/02 showed a metastatic lesion on MRI in the lower thoracic region  and focal increased uptake in the lateral tibial plateau o f R. knee.
Back pain: Pt. c/o moderately severe back pain throughout hospital stay at MSRH.  Thoracic spine xrays on 7/31/02 showed osteopenia with no acute fracture or subluxation.  An MRI of thoracic spin (8/02/02) showed a marrow replacing process in the L. T10 pedicle and another smaller lesion at the L. inferior aspect of T11.  The lesion was suspicious for metastatic disease.  No epidural extension was noted.  There was a patent spinal canal and lack of impingement on the thoracic cord.  Pt. received dilaudid 1-3 mg q4hours prn back pain.  As per psych notes, she did not wish to change medications to methadone or fentanyl.  A CT guided bx of the thoracic spine took place on 8/15/02 and was non-diagnostic.  A neurosurgery consult reported that an open bx might destabilize her given the locationo f the pedicle and recommended that the biopsy be done at GCH.    A repeat MRI was done on 8/20/02 due to increasing c/o back pain and showed a 50% compression fx of T4, persitent abnl marrow signal in L. pedicle of T11, and overall heterogenous marrow signal pattern throughout the visualized vertebral bodies.  Immunoelectrophoresis was ordered to r/o myeloma.  
Right Breast Mass:  A firm R. breast mass was noted at the 7 o/clock position of R. breast at site of lumpectomy scar and the thickening was thought to be 2/2 to previous sx by surgeous at OSH.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  
Renal failure:  Pt. developed renal failure while on vancomycin with an increase of cr from 1.1 to 2.4.  Her vancomycin level was noted to be >60 on 8/13/02 and vanco was discontinued.  Repeat blood cultures were negative for S. aureus.  
Anemia: On admission to Rafael Hospital, Hb/Hct: 11.6/35.5.  She was started on procrit by hematology.  She was transfused on unit of PRBCs in the hospital.
TIA:  Pt. has a hx of TIAs with one episode while hospitalized significant for difficulty with speech and R. hand tingling.  An MRI that day showed new increased signal w/in the ventricles and subarachnoid space noted diffusely.  This finding was likely due to prior IV contrast administration of gadolinium, though an underlying hemorrhage or infection could not be excluded.  A brain MRI on 8/18/02 showed resolution of abnl signal w/in the ventricles, decrease in  high signal in the subarachnoid space, likely representing resolution of sequelae from prior IV gadolinium.  No findings of meningitis but persisting increased signal w/in the L. lope, which may represent vitreal hemorrhage.  
HTN: Pt. required adjustments in her meciations during her hospital stay to control hypertension.

LABS PENDING

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
80F with multiple medical problems including breast ca s/p R. breast lumpectomy, chemotherapy and radiation treatment 30 years ago, recurrent syncope, and seizure disorder who was admitted to San Rafael Hospital following a syncopal event on 7/30/02.  Found to have a MRSA bacteremia with an unidentified source, lesions at T10/T11 on spinal MRI, and continued c/o back pain and nausea.

Back pain: MRI of T spine with abnl and prior percutaneous bx non-diagnostic.  Differential dx includes metastatic disease vs. infection.  Neurosurgery  consulted at San Rafael who felt it to be a high risk procedure and tx here for further mngmt.  MRI read at MSRH indicated that lesion was more consistent with malignancy than infection.
-re-read of OSH studies by radiologists at GCH
-IR guided bone bx as per IR
-neurosurgery if IR unable to biopsy
-dilaudid 1-3 mg IV q4hours, reglan and zofran prn nausea
-consider pain consult

2.    ID:  Staph bacteremia at OSH, TTE and TEE showed no vegetations indicating that endocarditis is not the source, R. knee aspiration also negative.   Pt. has now completed 4 weeks antibiotics with renal failure during course of vancomycin.
d/c vancomycin
con to monitor fever curve
if osteomyelitis found on bx, will need further course of antibiotics
blood cx x2 now, and reculture if febrile
ongoing nausea and vomiting: consider non contrast head CT to r/o septic emboli, pt has had multiple MRIs at OSH
held erythromycin 250 mg PO bid, pt reportedly takes it as prophylaxis for R. arm cellulites, consider restarting
heart murmur heard on PE, not documented in prior notes; consider re-echoing pt here

Breast mass: As per San Rafael, mass on R. breast is likely due to thickening s/p lumpectomy thirty years ago.  A mammogram on 8/5/02 showed innumerable benign appearing calcifications in both breasts.  The R. Breast was significantly smaller and a heterogeneously dense parenchymal pattern was identified.  An u/s of R. breast showed no discrete mass.  A biopsy was delayed 2/2 to bacteremia.  
-consider biopsy of R. breast mass now that bacteremia resolved

Renal:  s/p acute renal failure while on vancomycin, recheck creatinine and hold vanco for now
-f/u creatinine

HTN: At San Rafael, bp medications adjusted.  Restarted on same medications here.  
-cont to monitor
-adjust as needed

Record date: 2102-12-01
ID: The patient is a 74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, who comes in after recent 5 month hospitalization for followup and to review recent course of events.



HPI:  I had last seen her in 5/02 at which time her DM was being treated with Lantus 10 units, and Glucotrol XL 10 mg bid.  Her Lipitor had been held as had her Actos due to elevated LFT's, and her Depakote had been discontinued by her neurologist.  Her LFT's had come down from her hospitalization in March but were still elevated at AST 87 and ALT 124.  Liver biopsy was being considered by Dr. Yamasaki, her gastroenterologist.  She also had been recently hospitalized at San Rafael for syncope with history of partial seizure disorder vs TIA with history of transient episodes of right arm numbness and weakness dating to 2098 but with no seizures in 3 yrs.



In July O2 she had several episodes of syncope, one of which occured in her neurologist's office.    She was apparently hypotensive and initially refused to go to the ED, but later her family brought her to the ED at San Rafael.  She was found to be bacteremic with MRSA and was treated with IV vancomycin.   Endovascular sources were found to be negative as source, as was a knee tap, and no source was ever identified.  She was transferred to GCH in August.   She had severe back pain and two bone biopsies were negative for osteomyelitis in the spine.  She was also found to have a 50% compression fracture of T4 and this was treated at GCH with a T4 vertebroplasty in September 10.  She also was worked up for mets to spine but only benign hemangiomas were found.



She was discharged to rehab in mid September.  She required at least two more admissions from rehab to San Rafael over the next two months.  She apparently had severe gastroparesis and was unable to eat, requiring portacath for TPN around October 10.  She had then gone back to rehab again but was readmitted with DVT of the left Subclavian vein around the site of the Portacath.  She was started on Coumadin and was back in rehab for another few weeks.  The arm swelling quickly resolved. There was also reportedly a TIA which occured after an MRI scan with right facial droop and slurred speech at SRH.  She was finally discharged to home on November 21st.



MEDS:  Coumadin 7.5 mg qd,  Norvasc 10 mg qd, Isordil 20 mg tid, Neurontin 300 mg po bid, Plavix 75 mg po qd, Prilosec 20 mg qd, Folic aid 1 mg qd, Synthroid 50 mcg qd, Labetolol 200 mg bid, Glipizide 2.5 mg po qd, Albuterol inhaler prn, erytab 250 bid, Ultram 50 mg q 6hrs prn, MVI, Vitamin B12 1000. Rhinocort Aqua, Nitrostat prn,  Was d'cd from Reglan, taking Donperdon?



PE:  WDWN BF NAD  Wt 135 lbs  BP 100/64



Heent:  throat clear,  EOMI. Perrl.

Neck:  supple without adenopathy or thyromegaly.

Cor:  RRR, no m's.

Lungs; clear.

Abdomen;  soft, nontender no HSM.

Extr;  no edema.



A/P:  74 yr old woman with multiple medical problems, s/p 5 month hospitalization.



1)  Diabetes.  Throughout her hospitalization she lost a lot of weight down from 160's to 170's last spring to current level of 135 lbs.  Insulin was stopped and just recently Glipizide 2.5 mg added on.  Recent Hg A1C obtained after this visit on 12/04/02 was 6.0.  Bun /Cr was 11/0.9.  glucose 196.  Cholesterol 225/68/135.  LFT's were not done and need to be done, will be ordered next lab draw.  If normalized then will add back Lipitor.  History of gastroparesis, on new med has replaced Reglan, doing better.



2)  Hypertension.  Doing well on Norvasc 10, Labetolol 200 bid and Isordil 20 tid.



3)  S/p recent upper extremity DVT, on coumadin.  Per Dr. Herbert Paris's note of 12/02, she needs 3 months of anticoag, and then 1mg/day until the portacath discontinued.  With history 2 prior DVT's will need to discuss whether she should be on long term therapy.  She is now getting FS INR's thru the VNA, but will be transitioned to Internal Medicine, with access thru the portacath, or continued FS's.  INR has been in good range with 7.5 mg coumadin.



4)  S/P  compression fracture of T4, s/p vertebroplasty with successful resolution of the pain.  Has other compression fractures but not interested in further procedures at this time.



5)  History of hypothyroidism.  Had recent labs at SRH on  12/04/02 with TSH of 1.3 and Free T4 of  0.9.  



6)  History of anemia, requiring Procrit and ? transfusions during her hospitalizations, with normal hct of 41.1 on  12/04/02.



7)  Neuro;  History of partial seizures, TIA's.  Followed by Dr. Gary Keyes.    History of silent cerebellar brain infarction on MRI.    History of moderate intracranial carotid stenosis, with recent ? TIA left hemisphere, ? repeat carotid noninvasives per Dr. Keyes vs CT angiogram.  On Plavix and coumadin.  Per Dr. Keyes coumadin alone would be enough for stroke prophylaxis, and he would defer to Dr. Barry as to whether to continue Plavix.



8)  History of elevated LFT's.  May have been medication related, due to Lipitor, Actos, Depakote.  Now off all meds, need redo as above, and consideration if normal of retrial of  statin.

Syncope

HPI: 
Ms. Yandell is a delightful 81 year old female with an extensive PMH including HTN, Sz d/o vs TIAs, dyslipidemia, breast cancer, and DVTs who presents following a syncopal episode on the day of admission.

Per a note from her neurologist, Dr. Gary Keyes, Ms. Yandell has a history of transient neurologic events, consisting of right hand numbness and weakness, in 2098 and 2099. She had an extensive workup in which it was unclear whether these represented a transient ischemic attack or partial seizures. She was started on Depakote for this. Between March and April of 2102 her Depakote was weaned because of a lack of interval seizures. EEG in January 2102 showed no evidence of epileptiform activity.   In July 2102 she had several episodes of loss of consciousness which ultimately were diagnosed as syncope. Dr. Keyes witnessed one of these events in his office in 7/02 and it was associated with hypotension.  

Ms. Yandell   s family describes her syncopal events differently, stating that she will stare into space for 5-8 minutes, during which time she is unresponsive.  When she    wakes up,    she is confused and sleepy for ~ 20 minutes and will often have nausea and vomiting.  These episodes are associated with jaw-clenching, but no tonic-clonic movements.  Ms. Yandell does state that she feels    dizzy and lightheaded    before these events, and reports that her family says she looks pale and clammy.  She does not recall the events herself.  The family does not report loss of bowel or bladder incontinence, although the patient did apparently lose continence of bowel shortly after being admitted (unclear circumstances surrounding this).  The family reports that EMS checked her blood sugar on the scene     it was normal.

In the emergency department, Ms. Yandell   s was afebrile,  82  158/70  18   95% on 2L.  She received zofran for nausea, ASA, and IVF, and was transferred up to the floor for further management. 

The patient denies that the episodes occur after she rises from a sitting position.  Do not occur when    bearing down,    or when she is exerting herself.  The episodes are not sudden     she appears to have some warning before one occurs.  She denies fevers/chills.  No chest pain, palpitations.  Some shortness of breath when walking, which sounds like it is unchanged.  Has had a cough for a few months and it is occasionally productive of ?color mucus.  She takes antihypertensive medications, but takes them as directed and by report does not group them together.

EKG: Sinus at 86.  Appears as though there is diffuse ST segment elevation, although when compared to EKG from >11/02, this appears unchanged.

CXR 7/28: NAD

Chest CT 4/03: 
IMPRESSION: Appearance of chest may be at baseline following
     right mastectomy with radiation therapy effect in right lung
     apex. Prior histoplasmosis infection could account for all of
     tiny lung nodules seen.

MRI 9/02
     Findings:  Diffusion weighted images show no evidence of acute
     ischemia.  There is susceptibility artifact in the region of the
     right posterior temporal bone which may be related to prior burr
     hole or craniotomy.  There are chronic appearing, small right
     cerebellar infarcts.  There are scattered periventricular FLAIR
     and T2 hyperintense white matter foci that are most consistent
     with small vessel ischemic change.  There is FLAIR hyperintensity
     in this sulci of the bilateral posterior frontal, bilateral
     parietal and left occipital lobes.  No abnormal enhancement is
     seen.  The brain parenchyma, ventricles and sulci are otherwise
     unremarkable.  The major intracranial flow voids are normal.
     There is a retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus.  There is
     partial opacification of the right mastoid air cells.  There are
     bilateral lens implants.  The bones, soft tissues and orbits are
     otherwise unremarkable.
     MRA:  There is signal dropout in the P2 segment of the right
     posterior cerbral artery.  There is diffuse irregularity of the
     proximal left posterior cerebral artery.  There is moderate
     stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.  The
     distal right vertebral artery is not well visualized.  There is
     otherwise normal flow related enhancement in the major vessels of
     the circle of Willis.
     Impression:
     Flair hyperintensity in the bilateral sulci with a posterior
     predominance as described.  This could represent hemorrhage, high
     protein content, high oxygenation or recent previous gadolinium
     injection.
     Signal dropout in the right posterior cerebral artery, consistent
     with severe stenosis with clot not excluded.  Diffuse irregularity
     of the left posterior cerebral artery.  These findings could be
     secondary to atheromatous disease in an older patient but
     vasculitis is another possibility.
     Moderate stenosis of the left paraclinoid internal carotid artery.
     No acute ischemia or mass lesion identified.
     Chronic right cerebellar infarction.
     Small vessel ischemic changes.

Carotid US 3/02
IMPRESSIONS:
1. RIGHT PROXIMAL CCA STENOSIS.
2. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
3. MINIMAL DISEASE OF THE LEFT CAROTID ARTERY BIFURCATION.
4. BILATERAL ANTEGRADE VERTEBRAL ARTERY FLOW.

Echo    01
1.  Normal cavity sizes, wall thicknesses and global and regional right
    ventricular and left ventricular systolic function.  Left ventricular
    ejection fraction is in the range of 60%.  There is no flattening of the
    interventricular septum, asymmetric septal hypertrophy or evident right
    ventricular hypertrophy to suggest any appreciable elevation of pulmonary
    arterial pressure.  There is a reduced mitral valve diastolic Doppler E/A
    ratio, which may represent a reduced rate of left ventricular relaxation.
2.  There is fibrosis of the mitral annulus (very mild) and of the interannular
    fibrosa between the anterior mitral leaflet and the posterior aortic root.
    There are also some echodensities within the very proximal aorta which may
    represent atherosclerotic change. 
3.  The aortic valve is trileaflet.  Cannot fully exclude the possibility of
    some thickening of the bases of the aortic valve, but, alternatively, the
    increased echogenicity seen within the proximal aorta may represent
    atherosclerotic change of the aorta.  There is no evident aortic stenosis
    or aortic insufficiency.  Very mild mitral annular fibrosis.  Otherwise,
    the mitral valve appears structurally normal.  Normal appearing tricuspid
    and pulmonary leaflets.  There are signals of trace mitral regurgitation
    and trace tricuspid regurgitation.  Flow velocity could not be optimally
    assessed in the tricuspid regurgitant jet to permit accurate estimation of
    pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
4.  There is no evident pericardial effusion.


 
ASSESSMENT & PLAN:

1)  Syncope : Unclear etiology.  History from family sounds much more like seizure.  Episode in neurologist   s office sounds much more like orthostatic or vasovagal syncope.  Doubt arrhythmia given prodrome.  Doubt mechanical etiology given not related to exertion.
Continue MI rule-out
Repeat echo
Continue telemetry
EEG
F/u TSH
F/U UA / Ucx
F/U guiac
F/U neuro recs

2) Hx of clot- continue coumadin

3) DM     continue outpatient regimen, but hold for procedures

4) HTN     continue outpatient regimen, but hold for low BP

5) Hypothyroid     continue synthroid

6) Hx TIA     continue plavix

Dear Dr. Mcfarland:


I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Marvinyandell at the Cardiac Laboratory in follow-up of her exertional dyspnea.


As you know, she is a pleasant 82 yo woman with h/o asthma, recurrent DVT on coumadin, breast cancer s/p lumpectomy + chemo and radiation therapy 30 years ago with resultant mild radiation fibrosis - now with recurrence in the contralateral breast, DM, HTN, HLP, anemia and hypothyroidism who is being evaluated at the CL for exertional dyspnea since 2102 when she fell and suffered a compression fracture. Her other respirtory-related symtpoms include orthopnea and intermittent wheezing with seasonal allergies. She has no chest pain, PND or LE edema.


Her work-up to date has revealed a mixed restrictive and (mild) obstructive ventilatory deficit which was attributed to kyphosis and radiation fibrosis + asthma respectively. She has had a negative cardiac stress test.

PHYSICIAN INTERPRETATIONFEV1 and FVC are reduced, FEV1/FVC is normal. There was not a significantresponse to inhaled bronchodilator. The reduced FVC is consistent with arestrictive deficit. Suggest lung volumes if clinically indicated. Since6/03/04, the FEV1 and FVC have not changed.








IMPRESSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: DOE is likely multifactorial. It may be beneficial to separate cardiac from pulmonary limitatio from deconditioning and I recommended a cardio-pulmonary exercise test to the patient, to which she agreed. In addition, as previously discussed, she would benefit from pulmonary rehab. Finally, I am not sure how much asthma is contributing to the picture. There was no response to brnonchodialtor today and the patient does not feel any help from it either. I told her that she does not need to use albuterol if it doesn't help her. I've requested RAST allergy testing to further investigate the possiblity of allergic asthma. We will not do the methacholine challange testing due to patient's already deacreased FEV1 (due to restriction) as it might be dangerous to precipitate bronchoconstriciton in the setting of an already limited reserve.

Mr. Fredrick is a 48-year-old man status post right middle lobectomy on September 24, 2096, for T1N0 carcinoid.  He has had no complaints, since that time, and denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He has gained several pounds, but is otherwise feeling well.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  He has no palpable cervical, supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy.  His blood pressure today is 130/88, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 89.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; and there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 100% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 20 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 232 pounds.  His chest is clear to auscultation and percussion, with good excursion and no change in tactile fremitus or egophony between the two hemithoraces.  Abdominal examination is benign.  I cannot appreciate any hepatosplenomegaly, and no other masses are identified.  He has no tenderness to palpation.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His incisions are well-healed, and no nodules are appreciated.  

The chest x-ray today is unchanged, with no evidence of new nodules, pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  His recent chest CT scan shows several stable parenchymal nodules and no evidence of recurrent lymphoma or carcinoid.

In summary, I am pleased to find Mr. Fredrick well, without evidence of recurrence.  The plan is to see him for follow-up in four months.

Mr. Fredrick returns to clinic three years following right middle lobectomy for T1N0 carcinoid.  He is a 50-year-old man without symptomatic complaints.  He denies any stridor, wheezing, productive cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis or fever.  He had a recent chest CT scan which was of concern to him.

On physical exam today, the patient appears quite well.  HEENT examination shows no JVD or thyromegaly.  No supraclavicular, cervical or axillary adenopathy is noted.  His blood pressure today is 132/92, with a regular heart rate and rhythm of 86.  S1 and S2 are within normal limits; there is no murmur, rub or gallop.  His resting O2 saturation is 98% on room air, with a respiratory rate of 16 per minute.  His temperature is 98.6, and his weight is 228 pounds.  Chest examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally to percussion and auscultatory examination.  He has good chest wall excursion and no evidence of wheezing.  He does not have any egophony.  His abdomen is soft, nondistended and nontender, without hepatosplenomegaly; and his extremities show no evidence of edema, cyanosis or clubbing.  The surgical wound is well-healed.  There is no evidence of local recurrence.

The chest CT scan shows two small nodules that do not appear to have significantly changed given the correction for volume averaging. The area of his previous resection shows no suggestion of recurrence.

In summary, Mr. Fredrick has two small pulmonary abnormalities that are not particularly suggestive of recurrent disease.  I agree with Dr. Ordonez's plan to repeat the CT scan in four months.

REASON FOR SDU ADMIT:  NSTEMI;  Awaiting cardiac catheterization

CC:  55 y.o. male w/ DM type 2, hyperlipidemia, positive family history for CAD, and hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who p/w NSTEMI



HPI:  

Mr. Fredrick is a pleasant 55 y.o. male with cardiac risk factors of recently diagnosed DM Type 2 (NIDDM), hyperlipidemia, and extensive family history, as well as, hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presents with chest pain, and found to have NSTEMI at Modesto State Hospital (MSH), transferred to SSH for cardiac catheterization.  Patient woke up on 1/16/05 with intermittent, stuttering ""pressure-like"" substernal chest pain, rating 7 out of 10, lasting from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  He is very active with walking exercises, and gardening, and had not experienced this type of pain before.  The pain radiated down the left arm, his left jaw, and shoulder, as well as, causing ""throat tightness"".  He denied associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, palpitations, fevers, chills, N/V/D, or any other constitutional symptoms.  He took an ASA 81mg PO x1, called his PCP, and presented to MSH.



In the MSH ED, his vitals were as follows:

T: AF   HR: 109   BP: 169/81   FS: 248

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 104bpm with ST depressions in V3-V5.  He received morphine 2 mg IV, ASA 325 mg, SL TNG x 2, Lopressor IV 5 mg x 3.  The chest pain resolved, and the pt has been chest pain free since.  6 hours after presentation he had 7 beat run of VT. He has not had anymore chest pain since the ER but did have palpitations with VT run. He feels his heart being 'irregular' at times.  He was started on IV heparin and an IV 2b/3a inhibitor, and transferred to SSH on 1/17/05 for cardiac catheterization.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Chest pain



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Dr. Fredrick Debra is a 59 yo with CAD, HTN, and DM2 who presents with three days of chest discomfort and hypertension.  His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  



He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).

ID/CC:  49 year-old right-handed man presenting with left hemiparesis and hemineglect.



HPI: This pt has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Per his wife, in April he described left hand weakness. He stopped smoking at the time and stated that his deficit resolved. He was in his usual state of health until this evening. He last noted feeling normal after the Coyotes game, which ended at about 7:30PM. He subsequently took a nap, per his routine, and awoke at 11:00PM to ready himself for his night shift as an RN. He took a shower and noted weakness in his right arm during the shower. After, while trying to put his clothes on, he developed progressive weakness such that his arm became plegic and he was no longer able to stand. EMS was phoned and the pt arrived at the GBH ED around 11:40PM. NIH stroke scale = 12 . Pt went for CT/CTA and required sedation and intubation to tolerate scan.

DIFFERENTIAL REQUEST   RECEIVED



Imaging: CT/CTA: old right parietal infarction; occluded right internal carotid artery; thrombus in right middle cerebral artery.



EKG: NSR, 68, LAD, no ST/T changes.



Impression: 49 year-old right-handed man presenting with right MCA-distribution stroke. He has a prior right parietal stroke apparent by CT scan and an occluded right internal carotid artery. Artery-to-artery embolus from the right ICA to the right MCA represents a likely etiology for stroke in this patient.



Recommendations:

1.	Admit to CMF neurology

2.	MRI with diffusion to assess distribution of stroke and whether diffusion/perfusion mismatch is present.

3.	allow blood pressure to autoregulate, with approximate SBP goal 140-180. When scanning done, pt should be extubated and exam followed, correlated with blood pressure.

4.	consider heparin if territory of infarct is not so large as to render hemorrhage into infarction too great a risk.

Neurology Clinic Follow-up



ID:  50 RHM s/p large R MCA stroke 10/20/69 with subsequent hemicraniectomy complicated by abdominal and head wound infections



HPI:  Patient presented initially 10/20/69 after a fall due to the acute onset of left-sided weakness.  Head CT showed hypodensity in the R MCA territory, and CTA revealed R ICA occlusion.  The patient was admitted to the neuroICU.  Follow-up head CT the morning after admission revealed hypodensity involving the entire R MCA territory.  Because of malignant swelling, he went on to require hemicraniectomy which was performed by the Simmons Neurosurgery service.  He recovered and was discharged to rehab on 10/28 with left hemiplegia and dense left-sided neglect.  Aspirin was prescribed for stroke prophylaxis but was subsequently stopped at rehab for unclear reasons.



His stroke work-up revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hr Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.



The patient was re-admitted on 12/02 with an abdominal bone flap infection.  The flap was removed and long-term antibiotics prescribed.  He did well and then was re-admitted 01/01 with fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting.  His hemicraniectomy site revealed protruding brain which required revision in the OR.  Long-term antibiotics were again prescribed for possible infection of the site.  The patient did well, but routine follow-up MRI of the cranium on 3/8 shows a large, rim-enhancing, DWI bright fluid collection adjacent to the hemicraniectomy site.  This may represent abscess.  Dr. Bennett, Simmons Neurosurgery attending, intends to admit Mr. Rico 3/27 for fluid sampling and culture.  Additional operative intervention may be indicated if this fluid collection is indeed infected.  Patient denies fever or chills.  He has had headaches frequently during the past couple of weeks.  This was a major problem early in his course but then resolved.



Mr. Rico has now been out of rehab for 2 months, and he is doing quite well.  He is able to walk with the assistance of a four-post cane.  His appetite is good, and he sleeps well on trazodone.  He has a very close family who is intimately involved in his medical care.  His spirits have been good considering the ordeal he has recently been through.  While in rehab, his wife apparently deserted him after accruing a great deal of credit card debt from gambling.  He cries when he tells me about this.  A close female friend has moved in to his home and cares for him 24 hours a day.  He is able to assist with ADLs but cannot function independently.  His left leg has some strength, but his arm remains completely paralyzed.  There are occasional twitches in the thumb that are not voluntary.



He has had a great deal of left shoulder pain related to subluxation at that joint.  An orthopedist suggested that the family consider shoulder fusion at some point in the future when the patient has recovered maximal function in the arm.  He also has occasional hip pain on the same side that is less bothersome.  Neurontin has been helpful for the shoulder pain, though the family believes that higher doses lead to a depressed mood.  They are trying to decrease the amount of Dilaudid he uses. 



PMHx:

-stroke as above

-HTN

-hyperlipidemia

-DM



Meds:

-Zestril 5

-trazodone 150

-Avandia 4

-Glucophage 1000 bid

-insulin

-Neurontin 400 bid

-Zantac

-Lopressor 50 bid

-Dilaudid 2 tid

-Lidoderm patch to L shoulder

-Pravachol 20

-Paxil 20

-folate, B vitamins



All:  Allegra -> unknown reaction



SoHx:  Lives with daughter and female friend.  Former RN.  No substance use of any kind.



Exam:

Gen - BP 120/75.  Pulse 56 and regular.  Well-appearing.

MS - alert and fully oriented, fluent and conversant, attentive, aware of current events.  Mood is labile with crying or laughing as appropriate.

CN - PERRL, EOMI, VFF with marked left-sided visual neglect, L face droop, tongue midline, SCM strong, unable to elevate shoulder on left, facial sensation intact

Motor - 5/5 strength throughout on right, L arm flaccid with 0/5 strength throughout, L leg with 2-3/5 proximal strength, otherwise 0/5 

Sens - intact to light touch throughout with marked extinction to DSS

Reflex - brisk on the left side with upgoing toe; otherwise normal

Coord - normal FNF on the left

Gait - hemiplegic with circumduction of left leg, quite stable with cane



Imp/Plan:   s/p R MCA stroke with hemicraniectomy, recovering nicely.  Potentially infected fluid collection at site of hemicraniectomy.  No evidence of systemic infection.  Subluxation of L shoulder.

1.  Admit for neurosurgical management as discussed.  Bone prosthesis will be placed at some point in the future (when possibility of infection is definitively ruled out or treated).

2.  Should be on aspirin for stroke/MI prophylaxis, but will discuss with Dr. Bennett before starting.

3.  Continue aggressive BP/lipid management.

4.  For neuropathic pain in the shoulder, will try Elavil 25 qhs.  Patient will stop trazodone.  If Elavil is helpful, may increase to 50 qhs after one week of therapy.  Once Elavil up to 50 qhs, would slowly taper Neurontin as per patient and family preference.  At next appointment, if persistent left arm paralysis (which is likely), will encourage surgical fusion of the shoulder.

5.  Follow-up in 3 months.

Visit Note



Patient Name: RICO, NATHAN C                     

MRN: 9190908

Dictated Date: 11/23/2071                    

Dictated By: Leroy Kelly

Date of Visit: 11/23/2071



Nathan was seen today in routine followup with Clinic Attending Dr. Kim Mays who concurs with the assessment plan that I will outline below.



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Nathan is a 51-year-old, right-handed man who suffered a large right MCA territory stroke in October 2069.  This occurred in the setting of right internal carotid artery occlusion, and hemicraniectomy was required for management of malignant cerebral edema after the stroke.  He subsequently developed an infection of the abdominal bone flap.  His stroke workup revealed a normal echocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor.  A hypercoagulability panel was negative.  Homocysteine was normal.  Serum lipid analysis revealed mild hypertriglyceridemia.  His recovery was complicated by brain abscess, which required surgical drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy.  Finally an artificial bone flap was replaced in October 2070.  He then developed persistent nausea and vomiting and a pseudomeningocele.  A VP shunt was placed by Dr. Bennett.  Unfortunately, even after shunting there was persistent nausea and vomiting.  This turned out to be a side effect of Fentanyl patch use.  The Fentanyl was subsequently replaced with methadone for chronic left-sided neuropathic pain, and the nausea and vomiting abated.



I last saw Nathan on April 2nd of this year at which point he was doing quite well.  He complained of some hot flashes of unclear etiology.  His depression seemed to be under better control on Celexa. 



Today he reports that he continues to have trouble with neuropathic pain on the left side of his body.  Fortunately he has managed to wean himself off of methadone and this has not caused the pain to get any worse.  He is using a substantial dose of Neurontin, which he thinks is helpful.  He complains that these pains involve his face, arm, and leg on the left side and he wonders whether there might be some relationship between the pain and the shunt, which was placed on the left side of his head.  He also complains of occasional leg spasms at night, which are not particularly bothersome.  His most significant complaint at this time relates to the hot flashes that he mentioned at our last visit.  These often occur several times daily, although they may not occur for several days at a time.  He explains that most of the episodes occur when he is in bed at night.  He first develops a feeling of nausea followed by a cold sensation on one side of his body or the other.  This has been followed by a feeling of heat from the top of his head down to his toes.  There may be a feeling of urinary urgency.  He then experiences a sensation as if he is floating on the bed, and generally this is followed by nausea.  The entire episode lasts only seconds but the nausea may persist for as long as an hour.  He also notes on some mornings he does not feel like getting out of bed.  He continues to experience depressed mood, and he longs to return to a normal state of functioning.  



He has returned to volunteering as a Big Brother.  He is unable to work.  His divorce is now complete and he is really glad about this.  He is living with a friend named Tejeda who takes excellent care of him.  



His left arm remains paralyzed.  He has minimal proximal strength in his leg.  He has a dense visual field deficit on the left side.  



He has one new complaint which is a feeling of numbness and tingling in the 4th and 5th fingers on the right side.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY include diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.  



CURRENT MEDICATIONS include Celexa 20 mg daily, Neurontin 600 mg q.i.d., Phenergan p.r.n., Avandia, Glucophage, Lopressor, Zestril, Pravachol, insulin, and aspirin 325 mg daily.  



On exam Nathan is well-appearing.  His hair has now grown back.  On mental status exam he is able to relate a cogent history.  He has a number of questions about stroke rehabilitation possibilities including a hyperbaric oxygen program that he learned about in Connecticut.  Eye contact is good.  On cranial nerve exam pupils are round and reactive and extraocular movements are intact.  There is a left visual field deficit.  The face is asymmetric with an upper motor neuron pattern left facial droop.  The tongue protrudes in the midline.  The left arm is completely plegic.  The left leg has greater than anti-gravity proximal strength.  There is left-sided sensory extinction.  Reflexes are brisk on the left and normal on the right.  Nathan is able to ambulate with a cane and a left ankle foot orthosis.  



We spent much of today's visit discussing various issues that concern Nathan.  Regarding the possibility of hyperbaric oxygen therapy for stroke rehabilitation.  I explained that there is no convincing evidence in favor of this approach.  There are some risks to hyperbaric oxygen therapy such as lung injury and the programs are extremely costly.  Therefore I advised Nathan not to pursue that option.



Regarding his frequent hot flashes, which are very bothersome, the etiology of these episodes is quite unclear.  Dr. Mays mentioned the possibility that these episodes represent some sort of diencephalic paroxysmal discharges.  I think it is possible that these are a side effect of Celexa; I believe that they first occurred shortly after starting Celexa.  We decided to stop the Celexa for a 2-week period to see if there is any improvement in the episodes.  If there is, I would consider changing to an antidepressant that works by a different mechanism.  If there is no change in the episodes we can go ahead and add Celexa back.  



I neglected to mention above that there is sensory loss to temperature and pinprick in the right hand involving the 4th and 5th digits and the ulnar aspect of the hand on the palmar surface.  There is no motor dysfunction in the hand.  There is no Tinel's sign over the ulnar nerve at the elbow.  The ulnar nerve in the ulnar groove is not hypermobile.  The symptoms and physical exam are consistent with ulnar entrapment neuropathy, which I suspect is the result of arm flexion during sleep.  I suggested that Nathan buy an elbow pad with a Velcro strap that will help facilitate keeping the arm straight during sleep.  We will keep an eye on this over time.  



No other changes are indicated at the moment.  I intend to see Nathan in followup in about 6 months.

RE:  Wagner, Lonnie

     MR #097-87-37-2

 

Dear Cecilia;

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Lonnie in the Clinic today.  As you

know, he is a 72-year-old gentleman recently diagnosed with

myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative syndrome.  He has required

blood cell transfusions for this.  He is currently receiving

Hydrea for this.  He also has coronary disease, for which he had

stents placed in his LAD and OM in 07/65.  This has been stable. 

He also had some congestive heart failure, for which he has no

further symptoms at this time.  His weight is only up 1-2 pounds

but has remained stable with an increased appetite.  

 

Medications: Include atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg

q.d., vitamin B12 injections q. monthly, metformin 850 mg t.i.d.,

lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d. 

 

Physical Examination: Blood pressure: 102/60.  Heart rate: 60

beats/min.  Neck examination reveals no jugular venous distention 

Chest examination is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiac

examination reveals normal S1, physiologically split S2, no

evidence of a murmurs, rubs or gallops at this time.  He has no

peripheral edema or clubbing.  

 

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm, nonspecific ST or T wave abnormalities. 

Compared to his prior EKG, T wave changes in the anterior leads

are improved.  

Wagner, Lonnie

MR #097-87-37-2               -2-                 September 29, 2065 

 

Impression: Mr. Wagner is doing very well from an ischemic and

heart failure perspective.  He remains on a good regimen of

afterload reduction and anti-ischemic agents.  At this time, I do

not recommend any changes in his cardiac medications.  

 

The patient was seen in consultation with Dr. Jacqueline Lam. 

 

Sincerely, 

 

 

 

 

David F. Irick, M.D.

Plan:



1.	DOE: Concern is new cardiomyopathy with failure secondary to adriamycin toxicity, nl ECHO in 2080

-check TTE tomorrow (also access for thrombus although pt already anticoagulated)

-currently clincially euvolemic, no diuresis for now

2.	New onset AVR with RVR: Possible etiologies:

 -new ischemia (cardiac enzymes neg x 3, no EKG changes)

-CHF (see above discussion)

-pulm disease (CXR w/ b/l small pleural effusions ), could be pulm tox secondary to chemo

-thyrotoxicosis (history of benign thyroid nodules but could be active now) check TSH

-rate controlled with diltiazem and lopressor, d/c dig

-already on coumadin s/p CVA with goal INR 2-3

3.	s/p CVA

-continue coumadin, check INR

4.	Prophylaxis

-nexium, coumadin

Assessment and Plan



Old records requested.



Numerous issues.

Cognitive dysfunction.  Suspect on vascular basis given prior stroke and longstanding severe HTN with small vessel disease.  Plan MRI of brain for further characterization

? SCCA of nose.  Derm referral.

L carotid bruit.  Given known cerebrovascular disease needs NICS 

Cardiac.  Obtain old records from cardiologist.  Recent ECHO and stress evals.

Voiding dysfunction.  Check psa.  Likely BPH but could relate in part to cognitive issues.  Begin alpha blocker as he needs better BP control as well.

COMPARISON: 12/22/86          FINDINGS:     Lines/tubes:  None.          Lungs and pleura:  There is continued right mid and lower chest     opacity consistent with loculated pleural fluid and atelectasis.     This appearance of fluid has decreased slightly since the previous     study. There is no  pneumothorax. No focal consolidation is     demonstrated in the left hemithorax.  There may be a small     posterior left pleural effusion as well. There is subtle     suggestion of Kerley B lines at the lung bases consistent with     mild CHF.          Heart and mediastinum:  The heart and the mediastinum are     unchanged from the prior study. The aortic arch is calcified and     tortuous.          Bones:  The thoracic skeleton is unchanged from the prior study.          IMPRESSION:     Continued signs of atelectasis and pleural fluid involving     predominantly the right mid and lower hemithorax.  The appearance     of this has improved slightly since the prior exam.  No new focal     consolidation is demonstrated compared to the prior study.          There is subtle suggestion of Kerley B lines consistent with mild     CHF.     Plan:
1. Recurrent pleural effusion: for repeat CT chest. Continue treatment for CAP.
2. Hematuria: hold off Coumadin at present. Monitor Foley drainage. Consult Urology if no resolution. Otherwise for outpatient follow-up.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: Alert Dr Joyce of admission as courtesy.
4. A Fib: rate controlled at present. Hold off Coumadin. 
5. HTN: BP poorly controlled. For admission anti-hypertensives. Monitor.
6. Psych: he appears depressed. Likely reactive to current poor health. I will alert PCP.
7. Code: FULL
8. Family: Daughter present and aware of plan

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN
Mr. Jimenez is a 78 yo male with h/o Hodgkin&#8217;s dz s/p chemo, T2m, HTN, AAA, CHF (last TTE 2086 with LVEF 50%, RVSP 45), a fib on coumadin, recently discharged after prolonged hospital stay for PNA &amp; complicated pleural effusion requiring chest tube placement, now returns from rehab with 20 lb wt gain since discharge on 3/09 &amp; 7.5 lbs since 3/20 &amp; increasing pleural effusion.  Increasing wt gain could be secondary to low ext edema. ?right heart failure 2/2 to pulm htn or perhaps diastolic dysfunction; however BNP not very elevated.  Patient&#8217;s albumin is only slightly below 3.4 as well.  Low suspicion for DVTs given exam with bilateral low ext swelling &amp; recent negative LUE noninvasive.


1.      Low ext edema/wt gain: Patient responding well to IV lasix from ED.
a.     Trial of daily PO lasix
b.     Strict I/O/s, daily wt
c.     Consider a repeat TTE, but recently performed 5 months ago so expect little change.
2.      Loculated pleural effusion:  With effusion enlarging, question if patient would be candidate for decortication/pleurodesis.
a.     Consider thoracic surgery consult
3.      ID: Will hold on further antibiotics at this time.  Afebrile without elev WBC.  Suspect CXR showing increasing pleural effusion.  Low suspicion for PNA.
4.      CV:
a.     Rhythm: Rate control with digoxin, labetalol.  Hold coumadin for elevated INR.  Restart when &lt;3.3.
b.     HTN: Cont Norvasc, labetalol, hydralazin, lisinopril
c.     PVD: Cont statin, ASA
5.      T2DM: Cont NPH 6 units BID + RISS


F/E/N:  No conc sweets.


PROPHYLAXIS:
GI: Not indicated.                
DVT: Coumadin
BOWEL: OBR

NAME:     Yager, Becky

MRN:      0887181



Becka returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy. She showed me a foot ulcer

that she has had since early August. In fact, this was debrided on August 9 by Dr.

Noyes and was found to contain Staph aureus sensitive to oxacillin and Bactrim.

She was treated with Augmentin for 2 weeks with little improvement. She has not

had any fever. She continues on her chronic pain medications and Percocet. 



On exam, the second toe on the right foot is severely swollen and red. There is an

ulcer which looks quite deep on the medial aspect of the toe. I had Dr. Drew

take a look at her foot who agreed that she should be seen in the emergency room. 



IMPRESSION:  Cellulitis/right toe ulcer - Persistent infection and unresponsiveness

to 2-week course of Augmentin raise concern of underlying osteomyelitis. Rebecca

was referred into the emergency room for further evaluation. She also was given a

new prescription for her Percocet #100. I will see her in follow-up in 1 month.

NAME:     Yager, Rebecca 

MRN:      0887181 



FOLLOW-UP VISIT  



Patient returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.  



Since last seen, her Dilantin level came back at 18.8.  She feels her pain has been

under relatively good control.  She has had a few falls since she was last seen all

due to losing her balance or tripping.  No lightheadedness or vertigo preceding her

falls.  She is trying to be more careful to avoid future falls by watching closely

where she is walking.  



She has no active infection at present.  She is scheduled for follow-up EMG nerve

conduction studies in January.  



ON EXAM:  She is her usual pleasant self.  Examination of the feet shows

hammertoes, numerous bunions, some reddened calluses but no ulcers or open

lesions.  There is vibratory loss to the ankles and absent ankle jerks bilaterally.  



IMPRESSION:  Painful neuropathy with 10-year history of progressive symptoms. 

Numerous previous work-ups for reversible causes of neuropathy have been

negative.  I would like to have her be evaluated by Dr. Phyllis Brewer of

Internal Medicine to see if she has any other ideas as to any additional work-up

or treatment.  Of note, previously had a DENA panel for sensory neuropathy

which was negative.  Rebecca was given a new prescription for Percocet #100.  I will

see her in follow-up in two months.

NAME:    Yager, Becky 
MRN:     0887181

Becky returns for follow-up of painful neuropathy.  A lot has happened since she
was seen.  She was terminated at her job working as a Credit Manager in December 2093.  She
therefore has been having financial problems.  She does not have enough money to
buy her medications.  She has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. 
She has not taken these medications for months.  She states she has been taking her
nortriptyline, dilantin and Percocet as previously prescribed.  When I called her from
the waiting room today, she walked towards me, she veered, and I caught her before
she fell.  We then got the wheelchair and wheeled her into the room and history was
taken.  She reports being off balance for about the past month.  She has been feeling
more unsteady on her feet.  She states she has not actually fallen but has come close
to falling.  She denies any true vertigo, ringing in her ears, headaches, change in
mentation, numbness, weakness or change in gait.  On review of other systems, she
reports a 20 lb. weight gain over the past few months which she attributes to not
working and being at home and eating more than usual.  She also notes that she has
begun urinating at night which she previously did not do.  She complains of excessive
dry mouth.  She reports being more thirsty than usual.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, she was her usual pleasant self.  She is alert and
oriented X 3.  Speech fluent without aphasia.  BP sitting 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Standing
BP unchanged at 145/70.  Pulse 80.  Cranial nerve exam notable for prominent
bilateral nystagmus.  Otherwise intact.  On motor exam, no tremor or involuntary
movements.  No drift.  Good power throughout.  Fine finger movements intact. 
Vibratory loss to the ankles.  Babinski flexor bilaterally.  

When she got up to stand at the end of the evaluation to leave and telling me she
was fine, she veered to the right and I again caught her.  

IMPRESSION:  Imbalance with history of recently running out of many of her
medications though taking her chronic pain medications as previously prescribed. 
Also notable in the history is new nocturia, increased thirst and dry mouth.  Her
exam is notable for prominent end-gaze nystagmus.  Therefore I suspect toxic
metabolic cause.  As she will need STAT lytes, blood sugar, dilantin level and tox
screen as well as cardiac evaluation, the patient was referred to PROMPTCARE ER.  I will be
in touch with the physicians after they see her.

Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note



Patient Name:  REBECCA YAGER

MR#:  0887181

Date of Admission:  4/11/96

Attending:  Dr. Georgia Xing

Intern:  Branden Ocasio



ID/CC:    There's a herd of elephants on my chest.    



HPI: 	69 yo F with PMH of DM, HTN, s/p MI one year ago, now presents with substernal chest pain and increased shortness of breath x 2 days.  Patient was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began experiencing unremitting substernal chest pain, nonradiating.  This pain was constant,    24 hours/day   , and    felt like a herd of elephants on my chest.     This was accompanied by an increased shortness of breath, especially with exertion, which the patient had not experienced before.  The chest pain and shortness of breath would wake her up at night, accompanied by drenching sweats and a dizziness,    I felt like I was about to faint.     Patient sleeps with two pillows at baseline.  The pain eventually grew to be so severe that the patient called EMS.  Upon their arrival at her house she was given 2 doses of SL nitro which improved her pain.  



In the TPG ED her vital signs were Temp AF, HR 70, BP 154/79, RR 20, satting 99% RA.  EKG showed a new Twave inversion in V3, otherwise at her baseline normal EKG.  IV heparin was started for possible MI given her symptoms and history.  D-dimer was elevated at 782. Based on these findings and her shortness of breath, PE-CT was obtained, which was negative for PE.  However, it did show multiple new mediastinal lymph nodes up to 9mm in size, as well as a 6mm nodule in the LLL.  The patient was given ASA, MSO4, nitro, and made chest pain free in the ED.  She was admitted for continued rule out for MI and workup of her pulmonary findings.  



ROS:  No fevers/chills. Does report cough, cold sores x 1 week.  The patient did report having slight lower quadrant abdominal pain, with some nausea but no vomiting, No hematochezia/melena. No increased frequency, no dysuria. No delta MS/LOC. 



Past Medical History:

CAD-s/p MI, although unclear when this occurred.  ETT 2092:  nondiagnostic for ischemia. No evidence of scar or ischemia.  Nonspecific apical thinning.

RADIOLOGY



Chest CT:  4/11/96

	No gross filling defect is noted in the pulmonary arteries to

	suggest pulmonary embolism.  There are several mediastinal lymph

	nodes measuring slightly less than 1 cm in size.  However, in the

	region of the AP window there are numerous AP window lymph nodes

	measuring approximately 9 mm in short axis.  These could be

	reactive or neoplastic.  There is a less than 1 cm left hilar

	node.  In the posterior left lower lobe there is a 6 mm

	parenchymal nodule. This is best demonstrated on image 65. This

	could possibly represent a malignancy.  Alternatively this could

	represent an intraparenchymal lymph node.  This does not appear to

	touch the pleural surface and rounded atelectasis would seem less

	likely.  Some scarring and volume loss is noted in the medial

	right lung base.  There is no pneumothorax.  No significant

	pleural fluid is noted.  There is no pericardial fluid.

IMPRESSION:

	No pulmonary embolism or DVT.  There are multiple mediastinal

	lymph nodes as well as a 6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.

	Neoplasm cannot be excluded.  A follow-up chest CT may be further

	value.  These findings were discussed with Dr. Hendricks at the time

	of dictation.



EKG:  NSR, compared to prior there is new flipped T wave in III, however no ST/T wave abnormalities, no evidence of infarction.



A/P:

Pt is a 69 yo F with PMH notable for DM, HTN, peripheral neuropathy and s/p MI with multiple admissions for rule out, who presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, nightsweats, dizziness, and new mediastinal lymphadenopathy with a lung nodule not noted on prior chest X-rays.  This constellation of symptoms may be viewed in several different ways:  from a cardiac standpoint, as presentation of unstable angina, given her hx of MI and cardiac risk factors; from an oncological standpoint, as a pheochromocytoma or carcinoid syndrome, given the sympathomimetic nature of her symptoms such as dizziness, abd pain/nausea, chest pain and dyspnea, and the findings in Ab CT and Chest CT, or a primary lung cancer given her history of smoking; from an infectious disease standpoint, as possible reactivation tuberculosis, given that she has a history of TB infection and treatment.  I believe the priority of the differential should be granted to the oncologic and infectious etiologies, given that she appears to be ruling out for an MI, has little to no ischemic changes on EKG, and is chest pain free with continued exacerbation of her shortness of breath and sweating.  Workup should proceed in the direction of ruling out TB, and establishing the nature of the pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.



CV:

--Rate:  well controlled without medication. 

--Rhythm:  normal sinus

--Pump:  On ACEI, HCTZ for HTN.  

--ischemia:  on ASA/statin.  Rule out for MI with CMs x 3.  Will obtain stress test in AM.  

  

PULM:  

--plant PPD

--send sputum cultures, consider adding AFB.

--send ANCA

--follow up CT for nodule

--nebs/O2 therapy to support breathing



ENDO:

--urine metanephrines for pheo

--5HIAA metabolites for carcinoid

--TSH

--AB-CT for evolution of adenoma

--holding metformin, will control with SSIR.



Prophy

--Nexium

--holding on fragmin for now-low threshold to resume for DVT prophy given possible oncologic diagnosis.

NAME:     Usrey, John 

MRN:       6762675



This is a 76-year-old man who comes in with a chief complaint of left calf pain. 

This occurs after walking about one block and pain is sufficient to prevent him

from walking further.  He will then stop, pain will disappear.  He will continue

walking at which time it will occur at about the same distance.  There is no rest

pain.  The pain had been present for a couple of months although it has been

increasing in severity.   



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Is significant for intracranial bleed secondary to an

AV malformation.  He refused surgery at that time at Campellton-Graceville Hospital and has done

well on Dilantin without any seizures.  There has been no further bleed or problem

from this malformation.  He also has treated hypothyroidism.  He is status post

TURP, cholecystectomy, and appendectomy.  He does have a chronic anxiety

disorder for which he is on Ativan intermittently.  He also has pustular psoriasis.



MEDICATIONS:  Dilantin 600 mg per day, which keeps his level at about 7.  At

these levels he has had no seizures.  He is also on Synthroid at 0.075 per day.  



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a mostly German-speaking man.  There is a

right-sided tremor which has been present since his intracranial bleed.  Neck

supple.  Blood pressure is at 140/80.  Weight 184.  Heart rate is at 70.  There are

no carotid bruits.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular without gallop or murmur. 

Abdominal exam - No mass, tenderness, or organomegaly.  There are multiple

scars. There is a bruit over the right femoral artery with a decreased pulsation there

compared to the left.  There is no pulse palpable below popliteal on the right side. 

There is no visible ischemic change of the right leg.  The left femoral is fuller, and

there is a palpable dorsalis pedis on that side.  



IMPRESSION:  Peripheral vascular disease, probably right iliofemoral.  He will

undergo arteriovascular studies.  He will also be placed on aspirin at 81 mg per

day.  In addition he is begun on Lipitor 10 mg per day for hyperlipidemia.  He will

follow up following that vascular study.  This evaluation was also communicated to

her daughter, Quinn, because of the language barrier.

Record date: 2091-07-04







NAME:     Usrey, John  

MRN:        6762675



Patient presents for follow-up visit after long hospitalization. He went in to have an

AAA repair and suffered a postop MI. He was in CCU for 3-4 weeks at which time

he sustained a Pseudomonas pneumonia, small bowel obstruction, and PE. He

subsequently had his CABG done at the end of April and was discharged at the end

of May to Grant Clinic. He did well at Grant Clinic and was discharged

from there on the 10th of June, and he presents to me for follow-up today. 



He states that he feels well. He denies any chest pain or trouble breathing since

discharge. He does not remember anything from his hospitalization otherwise. He is

mentally intact. He reports that he has not had a bowel movement for 3 days and had

some pain a couple of days ago. He is passing gas, last done yesterday. No dysuria.

His daughter reports that he is eating well, that he is at his baseline mental status,

that he has had not had any acute complaints at home. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: As per HPI. Also, hypothyroidism, seizure disorder

due to a congenital AVM, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular disease.



ALLERGIES: No known drug allergies.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin 325 q.d., atenolol 25 b.i.d., Zocor 20 q.h.s.,

Carafate 1 gm p.o. b.i.d., Celexa 10 q.d., multivitamins, thiamine 100 q.d., Seroquel

37.5 q.h.s. and 12.5 q.a.m., Flomax 0.8 q.d., Synthroid 100 q.d., Dilantin 150 p.o. t.i.d.,

Colace 100 t.i.d. 



VITAL SIGNS: Blood pressure 112/52. Pulse 72. Weight 162. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: General - Elderly male in no acute distress. Appears well in

consideration of his recent long hospitalization. Neck - No JVD or bruits noted

bilaterally. Lungs - Clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes or rales. CV -

RRR. Normal S1, S2. No murmurs. Abdomen - Positive bowel sounds heard in all 4

quadrants, although mildly decreased. Soft, mildly distended. No masses. No HSM.

No fluid wave. Extremities - He has 1+ firm pitting edema to his mid-shin. 



LABS: From June 13, 2091, show CBC with white count of 4.4, hemoglobin 11.2,

hematocrit 32.2. Chem 7 - BUN 26, creatinine 0.7, glucose 203, Dilantin 5.6. 



ASSESSMENT & PLAN: 76-year-old male, history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, status post CABG in April as

well as AAA repair returns after an extended hospitalization with complications of

pneumonia, SBO, and PE who comes in for follow-up visit. Despite everything,

patient looks well. 



(1)  CV. Will continue cardiac medications at this time. Will likely change Zocor

     back to Lipitor but will check his labs first. Patient would benefit from cardiac

     rehab at this time. He is scheduled to see Dr. Nutter at the end of this

     month. Will arrange for him to have regular cardiac care after this. He has

     seen Dr. Quesnel for his postop CABG issues.



(2)  PVD. Patient status post AAA repair. He has seen Dr. Uddin and is doing

     well. 



(3)  Neuro. Patient on Dilantin 150 t.i.d. as per Dr. Acuna. It would be okay to

     decrease him to 100 t.i.d. as he was before. Will check  his levels today but

     likely decrease to 100 t.i.d. Will refer back to Dr. Acuna for follow-up. 



(4)  Endocrine. Will check TSH. Likely will continue current Levoxyl dose.



(5)  Osteoporosis. Okay to restart Fosamax.



(6)  GI. Patient with constipation. He can start Citrucel or Metamucil twice a day.

     Can also use Dulcolax daily until he has a bowel movement and then decrease

     to every other day as needed. Can also adjust fiber therapy as needed.

     Instructed patient and daughter that if patient is passing gas, it is okay.

     However, if he stops, they should call immediately. 



(7)  Psych. They should continue Celexa and Seroquel for now. Will review charts

     from Grant Clinic to see why medications were started and will likely

     taper him off them.



In general, need to review records from Grant Clinic in order to see what

happened there. Will consider that in my recommendations for his further care.

Return to clinic in 2 weeks.

CHIEF COMPLAINT: &#8220;I came to the hospital b/c I have pneumonia&#8221;



HPI: This is a 84M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in 2091 who presents via transfer from Waverly urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia. The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.



On presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. 



Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently. He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks. 



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Other systems reviewed were negative in detail.

RECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

RH Cath (3/97) DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSIONS/OVERALL SUMMARY:


1. Right heart catheterization - normal filling pressures. Hemodynamics: RAP 


1, RV 25/2, PAP 25/6, PCWP 6, CO 5.73


2. RV biopsy was performed using a shor sheath through right internal jugular 


vein approach.


3. A total of 4 biopsy obtained, fixed in formalin and sent to pathology. 


Closing RAP 2.

Nuclear Stress 12/96 CONCLUSION

       The ECG is negative for ischemia.  The sensitivity of

       adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting CAD is limited.

       LV contractile function is normal.

       The perfusion iamges show a large area of mild ischemia involving

       the anteroseptal and inferior walls



TTE: 11/96. EF 60%, mild/mod MR and inferior wall motion abnormalities.

YARBROUGH,IRENE   810-86-43-7                        VISIT DATE: 10/13/78
PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The 
patient is a 54-year-old female seen by Dr. Paulson and also by the 
Oncology service.  Briefly, this is a 54-year-old female with a 
known mass in her vagina, who presents now with vaginal bleeding. 
The patient was seen earlier yesterday by the Oncology service, 
and is scheduled to have surgery for the mass to be removed, but 
she developed significant vaginal bleeding and presented to the 
Emergency Department today.  She is otherwise healthy.  Her first 
time seen in the Emergency Department or seen by Oncology was two 
weeks ago for increased bleeding.  She was diagnosed at the time 
with a necrotic fibroid, and was confirmed by studies to have a 
large fibroid at that time.  She now presents with increasing 
weakness and light-headedness and more bleeding. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department, an IV 
was started, and laboratory studies sent, including CBC, 
electrolytes, PT/PTT, and she was also typed and crossed and a 
urinalysis sent.  A chest x-ray and EKG were sent.  The patient was 
made n.p.o.  She is a preoperative patient.  Her initial hematocrit 
here was 23.  A full note was written by the Oncology service, 
and she is currently admitted to that service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Vaginal bleeding with necrotic leiomyoma. 
DISPOSITION (including condition on discharge):  As above.  The 
patient's condition on admission is stable.

RE:IRENE YARBROUGH
CDH#810 86 43 7
 
Dear Dr. Shirley:
 
Thank you for referring Irene Yarbrough for evaluation of her atrial fibrillation.  
Mrs. Yarbrough is 55 years old.  Over the past year she had had menorrhagia and 
underwent endometrial biopsy in September of 2078 followed by total abdominal 
hysterectomy in early October of 2078.  Her post-operative course was 
complicated by a pelvic abscess for which she was rehospitalized in late 
October and during that hospitalization had an episode of atrial fibrillation 
which reverted spontaneously to sinus rhythm.  The episode was accompanied by 
some substernal chest heaviness but no other symptoms and she was not aware of 
any palpitations.  She was placed on verapamil 240 mg daily and has not had 
any symptomatic recurrences.  Her abdominal incision is open but healing and 
she has been recovering well.  She has no prior cardiac history.  She 
specifically denies any exertional chest pain, palpitations, or transient 
neurologic symptoms.  She can climb a flight of stairs at her own pace but is 
mildly dyspneic at the top of the stairs.  She feels that her exertional 
capacity has increased somewhat over the past year and a half since she 
stopped smoking.  She does not have a known history of hypertension, however 
VNA has been documenting blood pressures in the range of 130 to 190 mm Hg 
systolic with diastolic pressures ranging from 72 to 110 mm Hg despite therapy 
with verapamil.  There is no prior history of syncope.

Her current medications are verapamil 240 mg daily as above and Premarin.  She 
has GI intolerance to several analgesic medications.  She previously smoked 
two packs per day but quit a year and a half ago of her own volition without 
any particular change in her health precipitating this.  She rarely drinks 
ethanol.  She has not had any prior surgeries.  
 
Family history is negative for premature coronary artery disease.  Review of 
systems is negative for thyroid disease and a TSH was normal during her last 
admission.
 
Physical examination reveals a healthy-appearing obese woman sitting 
comfortably with a blood pressure of 140/90, heart rate 73 and regular.  HEENT 
is externally unremarkable.  There is no lid lag and no thyromegaly.  Carotids 
are palpable bilaterally. Lungs are clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam 
reveals somewhat distant heart tones and I am not able to palpate the apical 
impulse.  There is a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdomen 
is soft and nontender.  There is a healing surgical incision in the lower 
abdomen.  Extremities are without edema.  Dorsalis pedis pulses are easily 
palpable.
 
The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at 73 bpm with a PR interval 
of .18, QRS .08.  There are low amplitude T waves in the lateral precordium 
and inverted T waves in I and aVL with slightly leftward axis.  An 
echocardiogram performed during her last hospitalization was normal, although 
with some mild evidence of ventricular hypertrophy.
 
My impression is that Ms. Yarbrough has had one episode of atrial fibrillation in 
the perioperative period.  She probably has mild labile hypertension which has 
not been previously treated.  This would explain her electrocardiographic 
changes and the echocardiogram as well as the possible predisposition to 
atrial fibrillation.  I took the liberty of switching her from verapamil 240 
mg daily to atenolol 50 mg daily.  Once her incision is further healed we will 
arrange for her to have an exercise tolerance test to get some reassurance 
regarding the possible co-existence of coronary artery disease in view of her 
mild electrocardiographic abnormalities in atrial fibrillation.

will see her again in six weeks at which time she will have the exercise 
tolerance test.  We cautioned her to take her pulse on a daily basis and 
report to us if it becomes irregular and rapid.  We also gave her a 
prescription for nitroglycerin 0.4 mg and instructions on how to take this 
medication in the event of a recurrence of the substernal chest discomfort 
which accompanied her transient atrial fibrillation.
 
Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in her care.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Paul N. Shelton, M.D.

YARBROUGH,IRENE   810-86-43-7                        VISIT DATE: 03/10/79
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This patient was seen with Dr. 
Nettles, Emergency Medicine resident.  The Chief Complaint, History 
of Present Illness, Past Medical History, Medications, Allergies, 
Social History, Family History and Review of Systems are as noted 
by Dr. Nettles on the record and were reviewed with him and with 
the patient.  Briefly, this is a 55 year old woman who presented 
with chest pain which was epigastric and substernal in nature, 
essentially sharp and non-radiating that had come on at rest.  She 
has several cardiac risk factors including hypertension, obesity 
and hormone replacement but had no specific cardiac history.  Her 
symptoms did not resolve with Mylanta. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  As noted by Dr. Nettles and is most 
noteworthy for normal heart sounds, although she does have a II/VI 
systolic ejection murmur at the apex (the upper right sternal 
border). 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  An electrocardiogram does not show acute 
changes but does have T wave inversions in V1 to V3.  These were 
previously noted in 10/78. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient required nitroglycerine 
and nitroglycerine, IV nitroglycerine and IV heparin with some 
morphine to relieve her pain.  She also received Lopressor 25 mg IV 
and was given some GI meds.  She eventually became pain-free, 
although she does admit to a residual mild discomfort in her chest. 
There are no electrocardiographic changes. 
IMPRESSION:  I concur with Dr. Nettles that this patient has chest 
pain suspicious for unstable angina.  She has responded well to 
aggressive treatment of this and she will be admitted for further 
evaluation. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admission. 
Condition satisfactory.

Patient Name: NARVAEZ, OTIS;  MRN: 6680255
Dictated at: 01/25/72 by HOLLAND KELLER, M.D. 

 
 
 
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN:  
Dr. Hayden Avery 
 
REFERRAL SOURCE:  
Above.  
 
CONSULTATION REPLY 
 
Thank you for sending this patient for neurologic consultation.  I have reviewed or collected the primary data and examined the patient personally.  
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  62 year-old left handed white male (crossed right handed for writing), with bilateral buttock burning dysesthesias radiating down both lateral lower extremities.   
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old man with a history of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, asthma, hypertension, attention deficit disorder, diabetic neuropathy and obesity who developed two years of gradually progressive discomfort in the lower extremities.  He has gained 40 pounds over the past two years and over that time course has noted that when he stands after about a minute he gets a firing burning pain in the left buttock just lateral to the spine which then radiates down the lateral aspect of the left leg.  If he shifts to his right leg, he gets a similar discomfort one or two minutes later.  This is relieved by sitting.  It will happen when walking as well.  This is distinct from the decrease in sensation and the tingling and cold feeling he gets in his feet due to the diabetic neuropathy.  He has had no back trauma, although he has a torn right ACL in the knee which leads to occasional falls.  Of note, he wears his wallet in his left rear pocket and tightens his belt to keep it at his waist.  
 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The past medical history is as above and also includes a superficial varicosity in the right mid calf.   
ALLERGIES:  Sulfa, contrast medium, Ambien.  
 
FAMILY HISTORY:  Non-contributory.  
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Hytrin, Cozaar 50 mg q. day, Ritalin 20 mg five times per day, glucophage 10 mg t.i.d., Rezulin 400 mg t.i.d., Neurontin 600 mg q.h.s. and Selexa.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is getting divorced and has four grown children all in good health.  
 
BIRTH HISTORY:  He was born with hammer toes and no other family member has this condition.  
 
EDUCATION:  He is a Consultant who works in Dupont.  
 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  He has limited exercise and diet.  He has 30+ year history of cigarette smoking and has has no cigarettes in the last six weeks.  He denies alcohol use or recent recreational drug use.  He has no HIV risk factors.  
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  System review reveals normal bowel function with frequent small volume urination.  He attributes this to his Ritalin use and has not seen a urologist.  He has difficulty achieving and maintaining an erection and had only minimal improvement with Viagra.  When walking he develops some symptoms of claudication which were immediately relieved by resting.  There is no cardiovascular, respiratory or constitutional symptoms.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  General: healthy appearance with a blood pressure of 175/90 in the left arm seated.  Pulse of 60 and regular.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Mental status:  Unremarkable.  Cranial nerves:  immature cataract, o.s.  No evidence of retinopathy.  
 
Motor:  normal tone and full strength in upper limbs.  Mild 5-/5 weakness in ankle extension bilaterally.  Mild distal atrophy in the foot intrinsics.  Rapid alternating movements intact.   
Sensation:  decreased to vibration and joint position in the feet bilaterally.  Mild decrease to pin over the medial nerve distribution on the right hand.  
 
The muscle stretch reflexes are absent at the Achilles and 1+ at the patellar, brachial radialis, biceps and triceps with flexor, plantar responses.  Finger to nose is accurate in both arms.  Gait is steady but distorted by the knee injury and slightly wide based.  He has a decreased tandem but can heel walk.  He has minimal unsteadiness in the Romberg position.  
 
DATA REVIEW:  MR imaging of the lumbosacral spine was performed at Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy and then again several days later at Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point (860-721-0108).  Report and films reviewed from Carolinas Medical Center-Mercy demonstrate no obvious focal disc herniation or spinal stenosis but some of the views are suboptimal.  The summary report from Bayonet Point suggests there may be some lumbosacral spinal stenosis and I await faxed copy of that report.  
 
ASSESSMENT:  
1.  Neuropathy.  The patient has likely multifactorial reasons for his lumbar spine pain.  He did undergo an evaluation by Dr.  Ulysses Harding which is unavailable at this time and one cortisone injection which was not effective at relieving his discomfort.  He likely has a combination of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, sciatic neuropathy and possible lumbosacral spinal stenosis or polyradiculopathy.  There is no evidence of diabetic amyotrophy.  I think at this point, an EMG with nerve conduction studies will be most helpful to identify the relevant contributions of these different factors.  I have also suggested that he invest in suspenders and carry his wallet in a different pocket to see if this will provide some relief.  He has tried a course of non steroidals without effect and I think I would like to begin with a low dose of amitriptyline as a neuropathic pain agent to supplement the Neurontin that he is on for other indications.  I will see him back in the office after the EMG has been performed and I have had a chance to review the MR imaging.  
 
Thank you for sending him to my office, it is a pleasure taking care of this gentleman and I am hopeful that we will be able to reduce his discomfort to some degree.  
 
The risks and benefits of any recommended or alternative treatments were discussed.  
 
DIAGNOSTIC CODE/LEVEL:  C5/peripheral neuropathy.

RE: Otis Narvaez

        MR   #04561326

 

Dear Dr. Huynh:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 

consultation.  As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 

of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.  Recently, he underwent 

evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 

dobutamine stress echocardiography.  The echocardiogram revealed reduced 

left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.  

There was no evidence of ischemia.  He subsequently underwent coronary 

catheterization.  I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 

told that he had no arterial blockages.  Symptomatically, he is 

significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.  He has attributed 

this to his weight.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 

although he has not been taking either of these medications.  Prior to 

his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 

upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.  This was confirmed 

subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 

lung malignancy.  He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 

you.

 

His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 

back pain, and obesity.

 

Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 

q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.  No drug allergies

 

Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.

 

Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.  He smoked for 

40 years but quit approximately three years ago.  He drinks rarely,

       MR  #04561326                                      -2-                 

                       

December 30,  2072                                         

 

Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.  He denies 

gastrointestinal complaints.

 

On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 

140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.  HEENT is unremarkable, neck 

supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 

without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 

regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 

murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 

CVA tenderness.  No clubbing cyanosis or edema.  Pulses full.

 

Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 

function by echocardiogram.  By report he has no evidence of coronary 

artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.  If indeed 

it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 

this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 

his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.  In any case, this 

puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 

than if he had significant coronary disease.  I see no reason why you 

should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.  Prior 

to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  

I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 

to South Side Hospital.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

 

 

Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.

RE:  Otis Narvaez
     MR #045-61-32-6

Dear Uddin:

Otis Narvaez is a 67 year old man who returned to the office today for follow-up after having
undergone an Adenosine PET scan on March 04, 2077.  His previous visit with me occurred on
February 19, 2077, where his acute complaint was shortness of breath with any activity.  He
denied chest pain, but did admit to a ""tight"" feeling down his left arm on occasion.  This was not
associated with activity.  He admits to being a very sedentary person.  

The results of his Adenosine MIBI were abnormal, with abnormal myocardial perfusion, global
LV function, and CT coronary angiography.  There were no significant findings on the clinical
evaluation.  The response was non-ischemic, and there were no EKG changes during infusion. 
The results revealed a small calcified plaque in the proximal LAD coronary artery without flow-
limiting stenosis.  There was a more heavily calcified plaque visualized in the distal RCA which
was flow-limiting, and there was a moderate amount of stress-induced ischemia on imaging. 
There was severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 32%.  The
narrowing in the distal segment of the RCA was greater than 70%.  

A lipid profile performed following his office visit on February 19, 2077 revealed a total
cholesterol of 182 mg/dl, an HDL of 43 mg/dl, an LDL of 71 mg/dl, and a triglyceride level of
342 mg/dl.  He has not been on any cholesterol-lowering medications.  

He had undergone previous cardiac catheterization in November 2072, which demonstrated
insignificant coronary artery disease, with an ejection fraction of 63%.

Since his last office visit, he continues to be significantly short of breath with any activity.  He
denies any chest pain or left arm discomfort.  

His current medications include Ritalin 20 mg five times daily, Ambien 10 mg at hour of sleep,
Neurontin 900 mg three times daily, Lasix 20 mg every other day, Lisinopril 60 mg once daily, 
Otis Narvaez
MR #045-61-32-6

March 12, 2077
 
aspirin 325 mg with Oxycodone as needed.  He usually takes these once every other day.  He is
now on 20 units of an insulin preparation that he cannot identify.  He takes this at bedtime.

Review of systems reveals that he has chronic peripheral neuropathy in his feet.  This causes him
to feel imbalanced, and it is necessary for him to walk with a cane.

He was diagnosed with diabetes in 2068 and hypertension in 2067.  He also has chronic low
back pain due to degenerative joint disease, as well as lumbar disc disease.  He also has
degenerative joint disease in his knees.  He receives psychiatric follow-up for his diagnosis of
depression.  

He underwent a gastric bypass procedure at Harmon Medical Rehabilitation Hospital in 2068.

On January 20, 2073, he underwent a left lingular-sparing upper lobectomy for a T1 squamous
cell carcinoma.  

On physical examination, he appears healthy, albeit overweight, with a normal affect.  His
weight is 208 lbs, the heart rate is 84 beats per minute, the respiratory rate is 16 per minute, and
the blood pressure is 140/62 mm/Hg.  Examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
reveals upper dentures in place.  There is no jugular vein distention, and the lungs are clear. 
There is increased AP diameter with bilateral gynecomastia.  On cardiac examination, the heart
sounds are distant, and there is a regular rhythm, a normal S1, a single S2, and no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops.  The lower extremity examination reveals a 2 cm tender superficial area on the
distal right calf.  There is no edema noted.

I discussed with Otis Narvaez and his wife, Santiago, my recommendations for a cardiac
catheterization followed by stent placement, as indicated.  He has agreed to this, and Dr. Yaziel
Kraft will perform the procedure.  His office will call Mr. Narvaez to schedule the
catheterization.  After leaving the office today, he will have a CBC, a PT, a PTT, and a
comprehensive metabolic profile performed.  He will return to see me in the office again in one
month.

Best personal regards.

Sincerely,


Kenneth Z. Sellers, M.D.

Chief Complaint

Dyspnea and exertional chest discomfort 



History of Present Illness

Patient is a 59-year-old Chadian gentleman with multiple medical problems including DM and HTN and ESRF, recently started on hemodialysis who is admitted for right and left heart cath prior to MVR/CABG/MAZE.

Pt presented 1 year ago  with complaints of increased abd girth, lower ext edema, and worsening DOE. Cardiac ultrasound at that time revealed severe mitral regurgitation secondary to diffuse ventricular dilation and papillary muscle displacement with ejection fraction   36%.  He denied CP, PND and orthopnea at the time and adenoMibi  showed inferior  thinning which might be consistent with a prior (silent) IMI without  evidence of ongoing ischemia.   He refused further work-up or intervention until recently. He presents now for cath and surgery.

Record date: 2067-08-02

60 year old gentleman presents for follow-up of right lower extremity foot ulcer.  It would appear that two weeks prior, the patient sustained a burn to the right lower extremity while walking on a hot sandy beach.  He has been followed regularly by a podiatrist Dr. Sanchez, who has attempted debridement of lesion.  He also asked that the patient receive vancomycin at the time of his dialysis.

In the setting of four compliance and poor wound healing, the patient was admitted for 48 hours to the Northport Veterans Hospital.  Records are not immediately available but it would appear that he received intravenous antibiotics at that time.  He was discharged without clear follow-up.

The patient presents to my office with his foot unwrapped and undressed.  He has been ambulating on the wound.  He reports that it appears less red and has less drainage than at his initial presentation.  He reports no pain.

Having spoken with his podiatrist, it would appear that the patient has been noncompliant with leg elevation and dressing overall.

Oropharynx moist without erythema or exudate.  Neck: Supple without JVD, lymphadenopathy, or thyromegaly.  Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally without wheezes or rhonchi or rhales.  Cardiac: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 without murmurs rubs or gallops.  Extremities: Right lower extremity with a 1.6 cm x 1.6 cm black eschar to be great toe.  Lesion is soft.  It is unclear if there is significant tracking beneath the surface.  A 3 cm x 2 cm flat based ulcer with surrounding callus formation is noted to be ball of the right foot with some granulation and no drainage.  A collar is noted.  No surrounding erythema is appreciated.  Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are palpable but clearly diminished.

Assessment and plan: This is a 60 year old gentleman with multiple medical issues including end-stage renal disease my for regurgitation, congestive heart failure, severe peripheral neuropathy, diabetes.  Present in with two large altars to the right lower extremity.  He is status post hospitalization and some debridement and appears to have had little overall improvement in clinical status.  I will proceed with an aggressive outpatient treatment plan however I suspect that he will need inpatient admission once again if significant improvement is not rapidly obtained.  A referral has been made to the Island Medical Center wound clinic for this Tuesday.  Visiting nurse has been arranged for his home for wound care in the interim.  He is advised to avoid all weight-bearing and to keep his foot dressed at all times.  I have explained to the patient that he is at risk of amputation of at least his right great toe should his healing not improve.

With regards to his other medical issues, he continues on dialysis.  I have asked for a hemoglobin A1c and fasting cholesterol to be drawn at the time of his dialysis tomorrow.  I'll see the patient on Tuesday.  

His blood pressure is appropriately controlled and he is no stigmata of congestive heart failure

At today's visit, the patient's wound was dressed and cleaned the our nursing staff

ROS
As detailed. He also has been c/o dizziness and weakness after dialysis, which was the main reason he refused to go for HD yesterday. No additional hx is available, no known sick contact per wife. When he was in ED, he was noted to have LGF 100.4, hypertensive and tachycardic. He is waiting for head CT and possible LP.

Head CT       IMPRESSION:

1. No hemorrhage, mass lesion, or evidence of acute territorial
infarction.

2. Extensive nonspecific periventricular, deep, and subcortical
white matter changes are likely sequela from chronic
microangiopathic disease.

3. Old lacunar infarctions in the left caudate head and right
caudate-anterior corona radiata.
Evaluation for acute ischemia is limited in the areas of extensive
white matter disease. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging
is more sensitive in assessing for acute ischemia and should be
obtained as clinically indicated.

HPI: Asked to see patient by surgical team in consultation for is multiple medical issues. I have served as his PCP for eight years. Pt seen and examined. Case discussed in detail . This is a 62 y/o male with multiple medical issues last admitted in September for increased falls, found to have a small stroke in addition to his likely vascular dementia. Readmitted last week in the setting of Purulent L foot ulcer/ S/P debridement and later TMA. He has a long history well documented in the electronic medical record which is notable for poor compliance with medication and follow-up. At baseline, patient has declined further cardiology workup for his severe mitral regurgitation and cardiomyopathy, has declined treatment for his hyperlipidemia and takes his blood pressure medications with less than 25% compliance. At the time of his last admission, he was actually admitted to a nursing home with plans for long term placement.


The patient's wound has currently not been closed. He has a vac dressing in place. He has been attending dialysis per schedule of nephrology. Current hospital course has been complicated by increased agitation and last evening, self limited substernal chest pain and dyspnea. This resolved spontaneously. He has also been intermittently refusing his medications and has been attempting to ambulate.


This AM.  the patient actually denies ever experiencing chest pain. He also only recalls his foot pain with repeated prompting. He denies any pain, dyspnea

EKG: NSR @ 90, incomplete RBBB, L anterior fascicular block; QTC 495 ms.


Assessment/Plan
 In summary,62 y/o male with multiple medical issues as outlined in this and many other notes. Presenting with necrotic foot infection, polymicrobial. S/P Rt TMA. Mildly delerious and certainly off from a baseline that was tenuous to start.


By issue:


1) CAD: The patient does have CAD, MR and cardiomyopathy that are really not amenable to intervention, given patient noncompliance. The best goal at present is going to be continued medical management. If BP allows, could increase toprol XL, although I suspect that this will not be an option. In addition, would aim to keep even at dialysis.


Certainly, cycle CKs and troponin and follow sx. I will defer to Dr. Shah, but I don't see clear benefit for cardiac cath, especially as we are not going to proceed to valve repair at this juncture.  If he were to become more compliant, this might be another consideration and as he is now a CT resident, perhaps this will be a future consideration.


2) Delirium: He does have a very tenuous baseline and has significant vascular dementia to start. He is off of this baseline, likely reflecting sundowning, medications and underlying metabolic processes. Please d/c medications that might be contributing to sx. Fluoxetine can be held for now as it was only started 3 weeks prior. Might hold ranitidine as well.  Haldol is d/cd in the setting of his prolonged QTc. Currently on olanzapine. Would continue to follow QTc closely and would d/c this med as well is still prolonged. Please send urine culture and surveillance blood cultures.


3) Infection: Appreciate excellent surgical management of patient's wound. Levofloxacin has been d/cd  2nd to concerns for altered mental status. All bacteria are sensitive to aztreonam so perhaps this would be a reasonable alternative. Would seek ID input to the end. Wound care per vascular with plans for D/C when stable and return for closure in the future. 
4) ESRD: Patient HAD dialysis today . Recs per nephrology
3) DM: HgA1c was at target. Please cover as needed with RISS for now. 5) Competency: certainly not able to make informed decisions at this time. Please confirm that his daughter is his HCP. Would try to use a Chadian interpreter and not daughters if at all possible.
 Thanks,

                           OFFICE NOTE
 
Chandler, Jessica
MRN #748-80-38-0
May 05, 2069
 
Ms. Chandler returns today for a follow-up status post her coronary
artery bypass surgery on 4/1/69.  Since the surgery she has done
quite well.  She was in Sibley Care Center from 4/08 to
4/22/69 and had undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy
and also education on dietary modification.  During her hospital
course she had a repeat echocardiogram which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and hypokinesis of the septal
wall with mild to moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  She was
started on lisinopril to help prevent diabetic nephropathy.  She
also received two units of packed red blood cells at her stay at
Sibley Care as it was noted that her hematocrit was only 24. 
She was also briefly treated with Epogen and it was felt that her
renal dysfunction may have been the cause of her low hematocrit. 
Her renal function has improved considerably since stopping
diuretics.  
 
Since going home from Sibley Care, she is starting to walk more
with assistance from a physical therapist around the house.  She is
not experiencing any exertional chest pressure, pain or shortness
of breath.  She also mentions she is currently going to a Diabetes
Support Group tomorrow and plans to get some psychotherapy through
Northern Illinois Medical Center later next month.
 
Medications:  Her current medications are aspirin 81 mg. p.o. q.d.,
lisinopril, increased to 20 p.o. daily today, Coumadin 5 p.o. q.d.,
Kayexalate 15 p.o. q. day, albuterol metered dose inhaler 4 puffs
q.i.d., Azmacort 4 puffs b.i.d., Lasix 40 p.o. q. day, Nephrocaps
one tablet p.o. q. day, NPH Insulin 75 units q. a.m. and 60 units
subcu q. p.m., Prilosec 20 p.o. q.d., Paxil 30 mg. p.o. q. day and
CPAP 8 centimeters water plus 2 liters O2 q. h.s.  
 
Physical Examination:  On physical examination her weight is 326
pounds.   Her blood pressure is 150/110, on repeat per M.D.
150/100, pulse is 80.  Her skin is without any rashes or
ecchymoses, or suspicious nevi present.  Heart regular rhythm,
distant heart sounds with positive S1 and S2.  Her lungs are clear,
there is no sternal instability and the sternal wound is well
healed.  Her extremities are without any edema.  
 
Her O2 sat on room air is 98%.  
 
Diagnosis:
 
1)   Coronary artery disease status post bypass surgery 4/1/69.
2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.Chandler, Jessica
MRN #748-80-38-0

3)   Diabetes mellitus.
 
4)   Anemia of chronic disease.    
 
5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  
 
6)   Intermittent problems with hyperkalemia.  
 
7)   Hypertension.
 
8)   Morbid obesity.
 
Plan:
 
1)   Coronary artery disease status post CABG.  She is clinically
     doing quite well without any signs of congestive heart failure
     or angina.  Her ejection fraction significantly improved
     postoperatively.  I am concerned about a relatively high blood
     pressure and the visiting nurses have reported that it has
     been going up into the 180s systolic with ambulation.  I will
     increase her lisinopril from 10 to 20 mg. with a careful watch
     of her potassium.  
 
2)   Chronic renal insufficiency.  Again we'll check regular labs
     once to twice weekly monitoring renal function.  
 
3)   Diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Her blood pressure have been
     under fairly good control.  She has also lost a significant
     amount of weight over 20 pounds.  Her current weight is 326
     pounds.  We'll check hemoglobin A1 with next blood draw.
 
4)   Anemia of chronic disease.  We'll also recheck her blood count
     and follow-up.
 
5)   Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient is using her CPAP
     machine at night time and I've encouraged her to do so.
 
6)   Hyperkalemia.  She will continue with the Kayexalate as
     prescribed and also we'll continue to monitor her potassium
     regularly over the next several months until they normalize.
 
7)   Morbid obesity.  She is making good progress with her weight
     loss.  She is going to continue on an out-patient program once
     weekly and she is also going to be going for some mental
     health counseling as well which will hopefully continue her on
     a successful weight loss plan.Chandler, Jessica

CHANDLER,JESSICA   748-80-38-0                       VISIT DATE: 01/08/70
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient was seen and 
evaluated by Dr. Wooten.  Please see Dr. Wooten's note.  The 
patient is a 41 year old morbidly obese diabetic female with two 
days of shortness of breath and cough, productive of some whitish 
sputum.  She has had no chest pain, no nausea, no vomiting. 
Minimal diaphoresis.  She has had a fever.  No urinary symptoms. 
She does have chronic renal insufficiency, COPD, CHF and diabetes. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  As above plus status post coronary artery 
bypass grafting. 
MEDICATIONS:  Lasix, Prilosec, Cozaar, aspirin, Paxil, Flovent, 
albuterol and Nephrocaps. 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  A non-smoker. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  An obese female, mild acute distress. 
Temperature 101 degrees.  Heart has a regular rate and rhythm. 
Lungs:  Diffuse rhonchi throughout with bibasilar rales.  The 
abdomen is obese, soft.  Neurologic exam is non-focal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Chest x-ray shows a poor inspiratory 
effort, no obvious infiltrate, perhaps some hazy infiltrates.  EKG 
is unchanged.  Labs:  Unable to obtain at this time. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated. 
Chest x-ray was obtained.  The patient has an IV established but 
were unable to draw labs.  Under my direct supervision and with 
some attempts by me, multiple attempts are made at the 
infraclavicular and supraclavicular left and right subclavian vein 
without success.  The groins bilateral have damp, moist exudate and 
the neck anatomy is difficult to assess.  We are unable to 
establish a line.  She has a chest x-ray for rule out of 
pneumothorax or hemothorax and she will need an arterial stick for 
blood draws. 
IMPRESSION:  Hypoxia, possible pneumonia and a facial abscess. 
PLAN:  Admission. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition on 
admission is stable.

Jessica returns today for follow-up after her admission for acute
shortness of breath and congestive heart failure.  I had added
Zaroxolyn on to her regimen which she is tolerating well.  However,
her recent laboratory studies show that she has a significant
increase in her BUN and creatinine.  Her BUN is in the 80's, and
her creatinine is about 3.4.  She states her breathing has been
excellent, however.  She is not experiencing as much dyspnea on
exertion.  She is sleeping through the night, and she is no longer
having any kind of dry cough.  
 
Medications:  Her current medicines are Nephrocaps 1 tablet p.o.
q.day, Paxil 20 p.o. q.day, Cozaar 50 p.o. q.day, Prilosec 20 mg
p.o. q. day, Atenolol 50 p.o. q.day, Lasix 120 p.o. b.i.d.,
Zaroxolyn 2.5 p.o. q.day, Albuterol nebulizers p.r.n., nph 40 units
in the morning and 40 units at night time and aspirin 81 mg p.o.
q.day.
 
Allergies:  Cephalexin causes questionable rash.
 
Physical Examination:  Today she is a pleasant black female in no
acute distress.  Her weight is 330 pounds.  This is down over 20
pounds over the past month.  Her blood pressure is 122/80.  Her
pulse is 80.  Her lungs are clear.  Her heart reveals distant heart
sounds but regular in rhythm and rate.  Her extremities are notable
for the absence of lower extremity edema.  Her abdomen is also
noted to be significantly less edematous than it has been in the
past.  Inspection of her left lower extremity reveals that she
continues to have an ulcer over the lateral aspect of the foot on
the plantar surface that measures 2 x 3 cm.  There is beefy red
granulation tissue surrounding this.  
 
Diagnosis:
     1.   Congestive heart failure.  
     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.
     3.   Morbid obesity.
     4.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.
     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.
     6.   Foot ulcer.
     7.   Depression.
     8.   Health maintenance.

Plan:
     1.   Congestive heart failure.  She is doing much better on
higher doses of diuretics with a weight loss of over 20 pounds
since her last visit here about a month ago.  At this point in
time, however, I think that we need to cut back on her Zaroxolyn
given the elevation in her BUN and creatinine, and I've asked her
to hold her Zaroxolyn dosage and continue on a relatively low-fat
and low-sodium diet and to have a scale and obtain daily weights,
and she will follow-up with me in the office in two weeks and per
telephone conversation in four days.  Should she have an increase
in her weight by more than five pounds, she will contact me.
     2.   Coronary artery disease, status post CABG.  Stable
without any symptoms of exertional chest pain.  Continue current
medication. 
     3.   Morbid obesity.  She decided not to go to the Frankfort State Hospital weight loss program.  I strongly wanted her to go
on a liquid protein diet plan, but she states it's inconvenient for
her to come to the Hospital at night time for the meetings.  She is
planning to try and enroll in a program at Sibley Care.  I told her I would help her out in any way possible, but
strongly reinforced to her the need for her to take off weight.  
     4.   Adult-onset diabetes mellitus.  Stable.  Continue current
regimen.  
     5.   Chronic renal insufficiency.  The plan as above is to
stop Zaroxolyn and repeat electrolytes in five days. 
     6.   Diabetic foot ulcer.  I also gave her a duoderm dressing
to try, and she is going to continue to follow-up with her
podiatrist, and I will speak with her visiting nurse about
appropriate treatment.

She returns for follow-up visit.  She has essential hypertension
and diabetes and is s/p a small CVA.  Medications currently include
vasotec 20 b.i.d., chlorpropamide 250 b.i.d.  I once again
encouraged her to take aspirin which she said gives her a funny
feeling in her stomach, but she is now agreeable to taking 80 mg
q.d.  Hydrochlorothiazide was stopped secondary to an episode of
hyponatremia.  She said she has felt the best over the last three
months and reports no cardiovascular or neurological symptoms. 
Blood pressure 130/70.  No JVD.  Carotid impulses normal.  No
bruits.  Lungs clear.  Cardiac exam normal.  Unremarkable abdomen. 
Full pulses throughout with no edema.  ECG is within normal limits. 
I have made no changes to her medical regimen and she will return
to see Dr. Isaiah Viola in six months.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Umali returns for followup after her angioplasty of a superficial femoral artery occlusive disease, with a more proximal left iliac stent placement of the common iliac. She has a nonhealing left great toe ulceration. She is followed by Dr. Holden, and I performed an endovascular recanalization.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Today, she is doing well, after her procedure on 09/14/77.



IMAGING: Noninvasive vascular lab studies were performed today, showing an ABI on the left of 0.67 on the right of 0.42. This is a great improvement from the 0.24 ABI on the left before the endovascular procedure.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Dr. Holden explained to the patient and family about toe amputation recommendations at this time. Otherwise, from a circulatory standpoint, we counseled them that this was the optimal time to perform toe amputation to allow for primary healing.



They will follow up with Dr. Holden in 2 weeks, once they decide.

PATIENT NAME:  MEYER, OSCAR;    MRN:  2771447

Dictated on:  02/06/2095 by VICTOR M. ZUBIA, M.D.





Oncology CONSULTATION NOTE:



DATE OF CONSULTATION:



DIAGNOSIS:  T2b, NX, M0 Gleason 4+3=7 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.



HISTORY:  Mr. Meyar is a delightful patient referred to me by Dr. Osiel Mckee.  His PSA in 2093 was 3.8, early this year 6.3, and on repeat 7.1.  Abnormality was noted on digital rectal exam.  He has very little in the way of voiding symptoms with a good stream, no dribbling, nor any frequency.  He does still have his erections, though they are not as good as they used to be.  The erections are still an important issue with him.  Dr. Mckee performed a transrectal ultrasound that showed a 13 cc prostate.  He took 12 biopsy cores and all 12 demonstrated prostate cancer.  In 4 it was Gleason 6 and in the remainder Gleason 7.  Many cores had a predominant Gleason 4 pattern.  Many of the cores were heavily involved with 40% involvement or more.  Mr. Mercado has a CT scan and a pelvic MRI scheduled for next week.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.	Diabetes.

2.	Nephrolithiasis status post lithotripsy.

3.	Tonsillectomy.

4.	Right inguinal hernia repair.

5.	Inflammatory bowel disease.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glipizide, metformin, and Avandia.



DRUG ALLERGIES:  None known.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  His father was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his late 70s, but he did not die from his disease.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He works as a Web Developer in Audiovox.  He is married and came with his wife to the appointment today.  He has no children.  He is a former smoker and occasional drinker.





PHYSICAL EXAM:

No anemia, jaundice, cyanosis, or clubbing

No gynecomastia

Respiration comfortable

No neurologic abnormalities in the arms or legs

No skeletal deformity or tenderness

Head, eyes, ears, and nose normal 

Abdomen soft with no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nor any additional masses.

No hernias.

Normal penis, scrotum, and testes.

Rectum: no mural lesion. Stool guaiac negative

Prostate is small.  The entire right side of his gland is taken up with tumor.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Mr. Meyer is a young man with a significant and quite bulky prostate cancer.  I certainly do not think active surveillance is an option for him, which is a shame, as that was his preference.  Left untreated, I think he will be in deep trouble at some stage over the next few years.  His second choice for treatment is prostate brachytherapy but again I believe his disease is too extensive for this and brachytherapy would represent significant under treatment.



On balance, my preference for him is either to have a radical prostatectomy, perhaps followed by postoperative radiation or alternatively, if he wishes to avoid surgery and he does, for him to have high-dose external radiation in conjunction with neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation.  While I think he will recover good voiding function after either of these treatment combinations his sex life is under threat and he is aware of this.  We will defer the final decision next week until he has had his scans.  Obviously, should they show extensive extracapsular disease then surgery will be off the table, if they show nodal disease the same is true and we will be thinking in terms of long-term androgen deprivation.  Hopefully neither of these scenarios will occur.

Oncology COMPLETION NOTE 

Patient: Oscar Meyer  #277-14-47

RADIATION ONCOLOGIST: VICTOR M. ZUBIA, MD 

DATES OF RADIATION: 5/27/95 - 7/24/95 (58 elapsed days) 

DIAGNOSIS: Prostate adenocarcinoma T2B Nx,  Gleason 4+3 = 7,  PSA 7.1

CONCISE HISTORY: Mr. Meyer is a 63 year old man who was found to have an elevated PSA of 7.1 on screening exam. An abnormality was also noted on DRE at that time.  Prostate biopsy was performed, and all 12 cores were positive for disease, including 8 cores with Gleason 7 disease.  Prostatic MRI showed no evidence of extracapsular extension.  CT of the abdomen and bone scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease.  He was treated with definitive radiation to the prostate and seminal vesicles by IMRT, with concomitant Zoladex treatment.

SPECIAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The patient underwent CT-based imaging to define the target volume and the normal tissue structures and 3D treatment planning was performed for treatment with IMRT. Daily localization of the prostate was done using the BAT ultrasound. 

SUMMARY OF RADIATION AND TREATMENT ADMINISTERED: The treatment site was the prostate gland plus the caudal seminal vesicles followed by a boost to the prostate alone. 

The patient underwent external beam radiotherapy to the prostate and caudal seminal vesicles to a dose of 45 Gy given as 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy/day. He then underwent a boost to the prostate only of 34. Gy given in 17 fractions of 2 Gy/day for a total dose of 79 Gy. 

CLINICAL COURSE: The patient developed mild nocturia and more frequent bowel movements, for which he took Flomax and Metamucil. Mr. Meyer has tolerated his androgen deprivation therapy well.

FOLLOW-UP: Mr. Meyer will follow up with us in 3 months with a PSA in advance.

Ischemia: Plan for cath in a.m.  ASA, Lipitor, Lopressor, captopril, heparin gtt; tolerate up ACEI/B-blocker as tolerated.  Note that patient takes Viagra and therefore should ideally not have nitrates for CP, although he did tolerate Nitropaste at SCH; note that last dose of Viagra was Thursday, 11/29.  Serial EKGs and telemetry.  Will defer initiation of Integrilin until cath lab, as there is no clear benefit to starting now.  Need to check fasting lipids. 
Prolonged QTc: Etiology unclear, and no prior EKGs for comparison.  Will replete lytes for goal Mg=2, K=4. 
Pump: No ssx of CHF.  Will obtain post-cath TTE to assess for WMAs. 
DM: Holding orals while in house.  IVF with D5 while npo; cover FSBGs with RISS.  Will give Mucomyst and IVF for nephroprotection with cath. 
Ppx: Heparin.

	Interval History:
   Per HPI J. Jordan Duran:

64 y.o. male with known CAD. He has multiple risk factors and a cardiac history dating back to December 2095. At that time he was experiencing exertional chest pressure while shoveling. He initially attributed his symptoms to GERD; however the chest pressure began to occur post prandially and nocturnally. He was admitted at SCH where his ECG revealed non-specific ST T wave abnormalities and he had negative enzymes. 

He was then transferred to WPH where cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% LAD lesion, a 70% OM1 lesion, a 70% 3rd OM and an 85% RCA. His ejection fraction at that time was 40%. He was referred for surgery. He underwent a successful CABG x 5 with a LIMA to the LAD, a sequential SVG to the Acute Marginal and PDA, and a sequential SVG to the 1rst Diagonal and OM1. 

He now presents with recurrent chest burning. He states that it is similar in nature to his symptoms prior to CABG. His chest burning is exertional and is relieved with rest. He denies dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and diaphoresis. During a follow up appointment at SCH, he was referred for a stress test. Per Bruce Protocol he exercised 6 minutes and 0 seconds. He states that his chest burning symptoms returned and were lessened with SL TNG, though not completely resolved. MIBI images reveal severe large perfusion defect extending from the septum to apex with reversibility. There is also a fixed basal infero-lateral territory consistent with infarct. His ejection fraction is 46%. He was admitted for cardiac catheterization done today with full report pending. Reportedly RCA diffuse, SVG-PDA patent, SVg-Dx1-OM patentw/ mod. ostial stenosis, LIMA-LAD 100%, LM mild, LAD severe w/ distal 100%, LCx OM 100%. Plan is for med management.

Re: Nancy Werner

Dear Wanda:
 
Nancy Werner is doing better than the last time I saw her in May
in that the triglycerides have decreased to 460, pretty much where
they had usually been.  The LDL is now quite low at 93 but the HDL
has declined to 34.  All in all, the results are compatible with
better glucose control and the action of Atorvastatin 10 mg is
likely responsible for the very low LDL but on the other hand
discontinuation of the gemfibrozil probably lowered the HDL.  The
effect on triglycerides of the low dose of the Atorvastatin is
minimal and overall the triglyceride lowering effect is overrated
except at the high dose of 80 mg.  Even at 80 mg Atorvastatin could
not compare to the fibrates in the triglyceride lowering action.
 
Her current medications are Atorvastatin 10 mg, Lopressor 25 mg,
Procardia 60 mg b.i.d., Capoten 50 mg t.i.d., and  Insulin 22 units
A.M.
 
Labs: Cholesterol 220, TG. 460, HDL 34, LDL 93.
 
Blood pressure is 120/80.
 
I restarted the Gemfibrozil, 600 mg b.i.d. and left her on the
Atorvastatin 10 mg.  Although I don't expect any side effects with
this low dose of Atorvastatin and Gemfibrozil I warned Mrs. Werner
and her husband that if she should have generalized muscle aches or
weakness she should contact us and discontinue medication. 
I think that aggressive therapy is warranted in Mrs. Werner.

Dear Hicks,


I had the pleasure of seeing Hannah Hendricks in Internal Medicine today.  She was seen alongside my attending, Dr. Heidi Erik-Roy.  As you know, she is a lovely 52-year-old female in whom you have found a left lower extremity bypass surgery.  She comes in today for perioperative risk assessment.  Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has longstanding type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease.  She in fact has undergone lower extremity bypass grafting in both her left and right lower extremities.  Specifically, she is status post a right fem-pop bypass in 2066 and a left fem-DP bypass also in 2066.  It appears that her right graft has been functioning well, but her left graft was noted to be occluded many years ago.  She comes in now with a nonhealing ulcer and gangrene in her left toe.  You have planned a redo bypass for this upcoming Saturday.


Ms. Hendricks tells me that she has never had any history of coronary artery disease.  She has never had any chest discomfort, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, lower extremity edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.


She does have a strong family history of coronary artery disease with a brother who had several myocardial infarctions and died at the age of 48 of an MI.  She has a report of a prior EKG with suggestion of an old anteroseptal MI.  She has never had any evaluation for underlying coronary artery disease nor has she had any symptoms referable to CAD.


In terms of her functional capacity, she tells me that up until a year ago, she was doing spinning classes without any chest discomfort or shortness of breath whatsoever.  Because of increasing discomfort in her left lower extremity, she had to reduce her exercise and of late has only been able to do weightlifting without aerobic exercise.  She is however able to climb stairs in her home without any discomfort in her chest or any shortness of breath.  She is unfortunately limited significantly by foot pain.


Her past medical history is as noted above including type 1 diabetes for which she uses an insulin pump, peripheral arterial disease, status post bilateral lower extremity bypass, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.


Her current medications include aspirin 325 mg, which she started a few days ago, Lipitor 10 mg once daily, Diovan 160 mg twice daily, vitamin C, vitamin B and folic acid supplementation.


She has no clear drug allergies, but does get nauseous and vomiting with Percocet.


She is a past smoker and had smoked for approximately three years, one pack per day in her early 20s.  She works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting at giant food in Albemarle.


As I mentioned previously, her family history is notable for a brother who died of an MI in his late 40s.


On physical examination, her blood pressure is 135/79, heart rate is 97 and her weight is 137 pounds.  In general, she is very well appearing and in no apparent distress at rest.  She has a jugular venous pressure of approximately 5 cm of water.  She has 2+ carotids with no audible bruits.  Her upper extremities demonstrate 2+ brachial and radial pulses bilaterally.  Her chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, and a soft 2/6 systolic ejection murmur best heard at the left sternal border.  Her abdomen is benign.  She has no abdominal bruits and no significantly palpable aorta.  Her lower extremity exam is notable for a hyperemic left foot with a bandage, which is covering what is reportedly a gangrenous toe.  Her left lower extremity pulses are 1+ in the femoral, absent popliteal and absent distal pulses.  In her right lower extremity, she has 1+ femoral, with no bruit, 2+ popliteal, 2+ DP and 1+ PT.


An EKG done in our clinic today demonstrates a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 97 beats per minute with a left axis deviation.  There is left atrial enlargement and Q-waves in V1 through V3 suggestive of an old anteroseptal MI.  There are also Q-waves in lead III and aVF, which raises suspicion of an old inferior MI.


In summary, Ms. Hendricks is a lovely 52-year-old female with longstanding diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and peripheral arterial disease who comes in today for perioperative risk assessment in light of an anticipated redo left lower extremity bypass graft.  She appears to have an excellent functional capacity up until several months ago.  However, I am concerned by her electrocardiogram, which raises the suspicion of underlying coronary artery disease given the findings of a probable inferior and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction.  As such, I think that it would be wise to better delineate her burden of coronary artery disease by way of a stress test prior to her surgery.  Given that her functional status has been so good up until recently, I do not think that we need to delay her surgery.  However, I would start her on a beta-blocker and as such, I have given her a prescription for atenolol 25 mg once daily, which she will start today and continue up to and beyond the perioperative period.


During the perioperative period, we would recommend that she has tight control of her blood pressure and heart rate with a goal blood pressure less than 120/80 and a goal heart rate less than 60.  I would also make sure to obtain a postoperative EKG to ensure there has not been any changes.


We will try to arrange for an exercise test with arm ergometry and MIBI imaging for tomorrow morning.  If we are unable to do arm exercise, we will obtain an adenosine MIBI.  I will follow up with the results tomorrow after the study is performed.  As I mentioned because her functional capacity is good, I do not anticipate that we will need to make any changes in the surgical scheduling based on the test results.  This is more in order to give us a sense of the underlying burden of coronary artery disease.


It was a pleasure seeing Ms. Hendricks in clinic today.  We are certainly available during the perioperative period if any cardiovascular issues are to arise.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.


Sincerely,

HPI: Ms. Hendricks is a 52yoF with a history of PVD and non-healing wounds of the LLE s/p redo left femoral-tibial bypass with arm vein on 5/3/78 who was discharged to home yesterday and now returns after she noted a gush of blood from her left groin wound while coughing earlier today.  She was doing well until this morning when she coughed and immediately noted that her left pant leg was soaked with blood from the left groin down the left leg.  When she took off her pants there was no active bleeding from the wound and she denies any light-headedness or dizziness.  There has been no further bleeding from the wound and she is otherwise without complaints.

Assessment/Plan: 
- 52yoF s/p recent redo left fem-tib bypass with right arm vein with single episode of bleeding from left groin wound.  This likely represents extrusion of a postoperative hematoma.  There is currently no evidence of active bleeding from the wound.  A CBC should be obtained in the ED to ensure that her hct is stable and she can then d/c home.  She will follow up with Dr. Ishikawa at her scheduled postop visit.  Should the bleeding persist or return she should return to the ER or the clinic for a vascular U/S to assess for a pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula.

Dear Dr. Schmidt:

Your patient, Hannah Hendricks, was in the Surgery Clinic today.  As you know, she is a 52-year-old woman with a history of peripheral vascular disease.  She underwent a redo left femoral to anterior tibial bypass graft using basilic and cephalic vein from her right arm on May 3, 2078.  She has done well since the procedure.  She is now comes here complaining of left foot pain.  She had an ultrasound in the vascular lab to rule out a DVT, which it did.  She explains the discomfort as pain and burning in the bottom of her foot as well as her arch and over the dorsum of the foot.  


On exam, she is a well appearing female in no acute distress.  She is alert and oriented x3.  She appears grossly neurologically intact.  Her lower extremity exam reveals easily palpable bypass graft pulse in her left leg.  Her left foot is warm and well perfused and she has a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  This does not appear infected and I cannot probe to bone.  It remains superficial.  She has no other ischemic skin changes noted. 


I have discussed with Hannah that her discomfort most likely is due to peripheral neuropathy due to her diabetes.  She also experienced this discomfort prior to her surgery.  She is enquiring about starting Neurontin.  I have said she would be able to try either Neurontin or Lyrica to help with the peripheral neuropathy.  She will return next week for her postoperative graft scan to assess her circulation.  She knows to contact us sooner if thing worsen. 


If I can be of further assistance in her care, do not hesitate to contact me.


Sincerely,


Hunter Shea, MD

On 6/11/78 she had graft scanning, which indicated a widely patent left leg graft and ankle-brachial indices at that time were normal bilaterally.  However, she presented on 9/17/78 c/o L foot pain.  On physical exam, she was noted to have a very small pinhole ulcer over the plantar aspect of her left great toe.  She now presents with increasing pain, &#8220;32&#8221; on scale 0-10 that is constant in nature, with occasional sharp spikes in intensity.  She also confirms loss of sensation and motor strength in the L foot, but there is no paresthesia.  She denies CP, SOB, N/V, flank pain, or any urinary Sx and has no history of cardiac disease.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

52 y/o F with Hx of diabetes type I and PVD, s/p several bypasses, presenting with worsening L foot pain of two weeks duration.  On physical exam, L foot is exquisitely tender and while it is warm to touch, it is erythematous and there is an ulcer on the plantar surface of the big toe.  In addition, ABIs from today show L ankle ABI of 0.19.  The etiology of her pain is an occlusion of the L fem-anterior tibial bypass vs. diabetic neuropathy, however, she has been taking neurontin without relief and the diabetic neuropathy is less likely.



- oxycodone for pain control, continue neurontin

- continue home atenolol, ASA, Valsartan

- NPO from midnight, pepcid

- check chem7, CBC, coags

- has an insulin pump

- angiography vs. angioplasty tomorrow

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic

vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial

bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity

cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.  She was recently treated

at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,

had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex. 

She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48

hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.  She has

also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not

had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or

other symptomatology.  She has also not noticed any urinary

symptoms of frequency.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and

fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in

2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies

tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,

respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on

room air.  General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no

apparent distress.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  The

abdomen is soft.  The patient does have insulin pump in place,

but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.  Skin is warm,

dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,

which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the

right lower extremity.  This erythema stops at the ankle and does

not extend up above the knee.  The patient also has an open

chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot

as well.  There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:

 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased

sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated

by me and the resident.  I confirm that I have seen and evaluated

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the

patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient as well as the resident.

The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.  CBC showed white

count of 14 with shift.  LFTs were within normal limits.  X-ray

of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray

of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.  Given the

erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this

vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of

vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed

outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting

her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.  The patient's

erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be

extremely atypical for a DVT.  We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is

followed closely by Surgery and this notification was

made at 8:30 p.m.

Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point

we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she

does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she

needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on

maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the

hospital.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.

We are consulted by Dr. Bonilla for assistance with glycemic management.



Mr. Ervin is a 67 y/o gentleman who is presently POD # 1 after AVR and 2V CABG.  He had known calcific AS and presented with increasing fatigue and dyspnea on exertion.  He was subsequently found to have worsening AS and CAD, including LM disease.  His peri-operative course has been notable for hyperglycemia with maximum BG 252.  He was started on an insulin  infusion according to the Portland Protocol and remains on 0.5-2 units/hour since midnight with BS 117-134-163-151-125-137-98-99.



Mr. Ervin recalls having been diagnosed with DM at the age of 19 as part of a military physical.  He was overweight and was placed on dietary therapy.  Per his own report his DM was diet controlled and ""seemed to disappear"" several years after initial diagnosis.  Approximately 4 years ago he experienced blurry vision and was again noted to have elevated BGs (he is uncertain of the magnitude of the BG elevation).  He resumed dietary therapy and has achieved good control with a  pre-op A1c of 6.2.  He is followed at the Skiff.  He has never been on insulin or OHAs and denies knowledge of diabetic complications.  He checks BS at home sporadically which are usually in the low-mid 100s.  He says when he experiences hyperglycemic symptoms (i.e. occasional nocturia) he walks to bring down his blood sugar.  In general he is active, walking several miles/day.



Past Medical History: HTN, AS, DM2 as above



Current Medications: Insulin, K/Mg, ASA, Toradol, Zofran, Vanco, Carafate



Social History: remote tobacco, ETOH



Famiy History: Son with DM1,  Grandmother with DM



ROS: Denies HA or changes in vision.  +SOB PTA.  No abdominal pain or changes in bowels.  No dysuria, occasional nocturia.  No recent lower extremity swelling.  Remainder of review of systems is negative or as per HPI.



Physical Exam:



Vitals: 98.2 70 120/68

Gen: pleasant, heavy set (but muscular) gentleman in NAD

HEENT: NC/AT EOMI

Neck: supple central venous line in place

CV: distant HS

Chest: wound intact

Lungs: Clear anteriorly

Abd: S/NT

Extremities: no edema, well perfused

Neuro: A&Ox3

Skin: intact



Labs: pre-op A1c 6.2.  Prior A1c 7.2 in 4/73



A/P 

Mr. Ervin has DM2 which was adequately controlled pre-operatively with diet and exercise.  He is presently requiring insulin in the setting of the stress of surgery.  Meticulous BG control is important in the post-operative period.  The goal is to maintain BS<175.  He should remain on the Portland Protocol until at least POD #3.  At that point only if he is fully stabilized and eating well can he be transitioned on to an alternative regimen.  He may transiently require subcutaneous insulin but will ideally be able to resume dietary control of DM.



Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of this patient. Our team will follow with you.

EDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEC^07/25/60^YERGER, DESEAN

The patient was seen with Dr. Godfrey.  I confirmed her history

and physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient. 

Please see the note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with

a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2

weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with

stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.  The

patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this

ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest

discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous

episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with

activity.  He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented

for further evaluation and treatment.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and

Altace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,

chest pain free.  Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,

and O2 saturation 98% on room air.  His lungs are clear to

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft

and nontender.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No

elevated JVP.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right

bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic

changes.  IV access was established.  Labs were sent revealing

essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.  Initial troponin was

less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was

normal.  The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival. 

Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional

beta-blockade was given to the patient.  However, based on his

story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given

Lovenox in the emergency room.  I spoke to the Cardiology B

attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his

service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future. 

With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a

diagnosis of unstable angina.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.

Dear Vernon,

I write to summarize for your records the recent IMC course of your patient, Dr. Alec Gipson, who was admitted to our cardiology service on 07/25/2060 with progressive angina and a small, non-ST elevation MI.  His cardiac troponin rose to 0.13.  There were no demonstrable ECG changes, though we queried the possibility of a left circumflex event.  He had been previously scheduled for semi-urgent catheterization and angiography on 07/26/2060.

His condition stabilized with institution of anti-thrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy.  He was taken to the catheterization laboratory by Dr. Otero on 07/26/2060.  Angiography demonstrated a high-grade lesion in the proximal portion of a large first diagonal branch, as well as a significant stenosis in the first obtuse marginal branch.  The diagonal lesion was managed with angioplasty and deployment of a drug-eluting stent.  A drug-eluting stent could not be delivered to the obtuse marginal lesion; a bare-metal stent was positioned without difficulty.  He did have smoldering chest discomfort of an anginal nature following the procedure.  The cardiac troponin elevated further to a peak value of 0.86 as of 07/27/2060 (08:54).  He also had a mild, vagal reaction characterized by flushing and transient bradycardia.

He felt much improved the following day.  A repeat cardiac troponin returned at a lower level of 0.75.  An abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of an AAA.  After consultation with you, we felt that he could return home, under the care of his wife.

He was discharged on the afternoon of 07/27/2060.  His medications included Ecotrin 325 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, losartan 100 mg daily, metformin 500 mg b.i.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg b.i.d., niacin 500 mg b.i.d., ramipril 2.5 mg daily, and nitroglycerin if needed.

Please let me know if I can provide you with any further information.

Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEXANDER^01/31/61^VELASQUEZ, WALTER

This patient was seen by myself and Dr. Hardin on 01/31/2061.  I

confirm I interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation, and discussed the plan of care with the

patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 73-year-old gentleman who

has a history of CAD status post stent in 2060, who developed

acute chest discomfort, pressure like, diaphoresis, and weakness,

while he was working as a chiropractor.  He says although this

was quite significant, it was not like his prior MI discomfort. 

He denies any radiation to his back or his arm.  He denies any

jaw pain.  He denies any fever, chills, or sweats.  He denies any

vomiting.  He denies any headache or neck pain.  He denies any

bowel or bladder changes and no lower extremity edema.  He is

taking his medicines.  He also took an aspirin, did get some

nitroglycerin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes, hypertension,

hypercholesterolemia, and CAD.

MEDICATIONS:  Cozaar, aspirin, Altace, metformin, and Toprol.

ALLERGIES:  He has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, not a drinker or drug user.

 He lives with his family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the HPI, otherwise negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is in no acute distress at rest.  He

says his chest pain is essentially gone on oxygen.  Vital signs

are as noted.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat:  Normocephalic

and atraumatic.  Pupils are equal and reactive to light. 

Extraocular motions are intact.  Oropharynx is unremarkable. 

Neck is supple.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Chest is

clear to auscultation.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  His

abdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly. 

There are no masses.  His skin is warm and dry.  There is no

lower extremity edema.  He has equal pulses.  His neuro exam is

alert and oriented to person, place, and time.  His cranial

nerves are intact.  He is grossly nonfocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  He has a white count of 8, hematocrit of 46,

and platelet count of 200,000.  His SMA-7 is unremarkable.  CK-MB

and troponin are flat and INR is 1.  His EKG shows less than 1 mm

ST depressions in V2, without any reciprocal or other changes.

ASSESSMENT:  The patient with a history of CAD with concerning

symptoms.  He did have a fight earlier in the day, although was

not under significant stress at the time of this event.  Given

his prior CAD history, the patient was given Lopressor.  Decision

was made to admit him for rule out acute coronary syndrome.  The

patient was admitted in stable condition.  The patient had

already got an aspirin and the patient remained in stable

condition until he was admitted.

DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out acute coronary syndrome.

Ulysses Peralta, M.D.
82 March Street
Coalinga, FL  84635


Dear Dr. Peralta:


I saw your patient, Dr. Gipson, in the Cardiology Office today on a somewhat urgent basis.  He was recently in Italy last week with very difficult events concerning his father's ill health.  His father ultimately died and was a very traumatic series of days for Dr. Gipson and his family.  He developed left chest discomfort, which persisted for a number of days.  He was afraid to take nitroglycerin despite knowing that he should, and therefore remained with chest discomfort for about six days.  He was able to be reasonably active and had no exacerbation of his chest discomfort.  He had no nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or palpitations.  He then returned to the United States and his symptoms have resolved.  Because of these discomforts, he wanted to undergo an additional evaluation.


We performed an exercise treadmill test with perfusion imaging two days ago for better understanding of his symptoms.  He exercised for 7 minutes and 30 seconds on the standard Bruce protocol to a peak heart rate of 122 beats per minute (84% of maximum predicted for age) and peak blood pressure of 162/80.  He stopped because of dyspnea and had some discomfort.  The discomfort resolved into recovery.  He had no ST segment changes.  His perfusion scan demonstrated normal LV size and normal tracer uptake in the lungs.  There was normal RV size as well.  There was a small-to-medium medium-sized defect of moderate intensity in the mid and basal inferior wall that was reversible.  These were no different than the prior study he had in July 2061.


As you may remember, in January 2061, he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated the presence of non-major flow-limiting obstructions and so no intervention was performed.


His current medical regimen includes ramipril 5 mg b.i.d., aspirin 162 mg daily, Cozaar 50 mg b.i.d., Crestor 10 mg daily, fish oil 500 mg b.i.d., metformin 500 mg b.i.d., multivitamins, niacin 500 mg daily, Plavix 75 mg daily, Toprol-XL 100 mg b.i.d., HCTZ 12.5 mg daily, and Nexium.


On exam today, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 135/75, a heart rate of 60 and regular, and weight of 189 pounds.  Head and neck are unremarkable.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows no jugular venous distention at 30 degrees.  PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 are normal with a physiologic split.  There is an S4 and 1/6 systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border.  Abdominal exam is unremarkable without organomegaly.  Bowel sounds are normal.  The extremities show no edema or cyanosis.  Carotid upstrokes are normal in contour and volume without bruit.  Distal pulses are normal.


His resting 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrates normal sinus rhythm and normal morphology.


I think Dr. Gipson is basically doing very well.  I think his chest discomforts for six days while in Italy may be related to anxiety and perhaps the known gastroesophageal reflux disease that he has.  I think there is no evidence that the discomfort was cardiac in origin.  His exercise capacity is quite good and his perfusion is actually somewhat even improved from his prior evaluation two years ago.  I think we can maintain our current approach.  I suggest that I see him in a number of months for future evaluation.


If any problems develop in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to help with his care.


Kindest regards.


Sincerely yours,

Robert J. Trujillo, M.D.

Department of Vascular Surgery

Lenox Care Center

21 Tamworth Place

Galena, MN  64864

 

Dear Dr. Trujillo:

 

Thank you for referring Mrs. Shirley Trent, a 68-year-old lady

with peripheral artery disease, on whom you plan to do

revascularization of the right leg.  Her history is well known to

you but I will repeat it for our records.  She has a long history

of cigarette smoking with a 3-packet-per-day history for 30

years, stopping 15 years ago.  She has developed claudication,

particularly in the right leg, over the last year since her

husband died, which has all the typical symptoms and is relieved

by rest.  This seems predominantly in the right calf but is also

in the right thigh as well.  She had segmental leg pressures done

which shows some mild diminution in the left leg but an

ankle-brachial index of 0.65 in the right leg.  An MR angiogram

showed stenosis, although I do not have the full report on this

as yet.

 

She has intercurrent problems with insulin-dependent diabetes

mellitus, which she has had for 10 years.  Her other cardiac risk

factors apart from cigarette smoking include a family history of

myocardial infarction in her father, and it is uncertain what her

cholesterol level is.  She has no history of hypertension,

although I am uncertain whether this has been checked in the

past.  She has a past history of partial gastrectomy in 2059 for

a bleeding peptic ulcer and this has led to some difficulty in

swallowing tablets and keeping them down.  She also has a past

history of a right middle lobectomy in 2079 for adenocarcinoma

that had clear margins and did not require further adjunctive

therapy.  She also had a cholecystectomy in 2079, which was

uneventful.

 

Systems review reveal no chest discomfort, dyspnea, ankle edema,

palpitations, syncope, cough, sputum, hemoptysis, GI bleeding,

weakness down the arms, face, or legs, seizures or visual

disturbances, and all other systems are negative.

 

She lives alone, and her current medications include insulin

only.  She has no allergies.

 

On physical examination, she is alert and orientated without any

signs of jaundice, clubbing, or cyanosis.  Her heart rate was 85

beats per minute with a blood pressure of 160/85 in both arms. 

The jugular venous pressure was not elevated, and her carotid

upstrokes were reduced, but she had no bruits audible.  Her apex

beat was not palpable, and she had a normal first and second

heart sound without added sounds, murmurs, or gallops.  Her chest

was clear to percussion and auscultation.  She had no

hepatosplenomegaly and no abdominal masses or pulsations.  She

had the scars from previous operations present.  Her femoral

pulses were absent on the right side and reduced on the left side

without bruits.  She had reduced but palpable dorsalis pedis and

posterior tibial pulses on the left leg but no pedal pulses on

the right leg.  There were no trophic changes in her legs.  She

had reduced sensation to pinprick in both feet to the mid calf

level in a stocking distribution.

 

Her ECG showed sinus rhythm without abnormalities.

 

Assessment:  This lady obviously has severe claudication and

requires revascularization, but is uncertain whether she has any

myocardial ischemia.  I therefore think a stress test is

required.  She also has difficulty in swallowing medications and

this will prove a problem for the long-term management of her

atherosclerosis, which I would like to further evaluate.

 

Plan:  I therefore organized a dobutamine stress test to assess

for myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular risk.  I have also

asked her to start on a small dose of a beta-blocker for reducing

her perioperative risk as well as treating her blood pressure,

which is elevated.  I have also asked her to have a fasting blood

lipid test today so we can assess her cholesterol level, as it is

likely that she would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy.  I

plan to evaluate all these in approximately a month or so after

her operation so that we can manage her in the long term.

 

I will let you know the results of her stress test when they

become available.  Thank you for allowing me to take part in this

lady's care.

 

Yours sincerely,

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Trent is 69, a pleasant lady who is now a widow well known to me for her insulin-dependent diabetes and her poor compliance with treatment.  In the past, she also has experienced upper GI bleeding due to a peptic ulcer and has undergone cholecystectomy as well as lobectomy for carcinoma of the lung.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Humulin N 25 units in the morning.  She is supposed to be using 28 units in the morning and 8 units in the evening depending on blood sugars.  She also has been prescribed an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker, which she has neglected to take.  Her last visit to the practice was in September of last year.

At the time of her last visit, I referred to vascular surgery because of claudication of the right leg.  She underwent a femoral public TL bypass in December and did well postoperatively.  She was discharged on simvastatin, Plavix, as well as atenolol and lisinopril.  She abandoned all tablets on her own and did not come for her followup appointment with us.  Today, she tells me that claudication in the right leg has disappeared completely but during the past two months, she has begun noticing pain in the left leg after 10-15 minutes of walking which forces her to stop.  An arteriogram carried out in September of last year showed mild diffuse disease involving the left common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries.  She did not have symptoms on the left side at the time.

The patient denies chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, orthopnea, and ankle edema.  Prior to her bypass surgery on the right leg, she underwent a Persantine MIBI which showed only 1 mm ST depressions and was considered not diagnostic.

Ms. Trent has experienced some polyuria and mild polydipsia and has two times nocturia.  She denies dysuria.  The last hemoglobin A1c was 8.4 in September of last year.  At that time, her serum cholesterol was 238, HDL was 59, and triglycerides were 263.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, she is pleasant and talkative.  Her weight is 127-1/2 pounds, blood pressure 180/76, and heart rate is 96.  Oxygen saturation 100% on room air.  Random fingerstick glucose is 202.  Extraocular movements are full.  The thyroid is not enlarged.  The neck veins are flat.  The chest is clear to auscultation.  The breasts are free of masses.  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  The heart sounds are regular.  There are no rubs or gallops.  There is a midline abdominal scar which corresponds to an old operation for peptic ulcer.  There is also a right upper quadrant cholecystectomy scar which is surrounded by a mass, which has been present in the past that probably represents fibrosis under the scar.  No other masses are palpable.  The lower extremities are free of edema.  I do not palpate the pulse except in the dorsalis pedis area of the right side, but there are no trophic changes and the skin is warm and pink.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A 69-year-old widow lady with moderately controlled insulin-dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia.  She has not been compliant with her medications.  She has suffered from peripheral vascular disease and claudication in the past underwent a bypass surgery on the right lower extremity in October of last year.  She now has mild symptoms of claudication on the left.  She continues to consume three or four beers a day.  The relationship to her vascular atherosclerosis is not clear.  Liver function in the past has been normal and she does not have significant proteinuria.  Today, I have repeated her hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive panel, CBC, and urine analysis.  I have spent 20 minutes speaking to her and to her daughter concerning the importance of compliance and explaining the rationale for the lisinopril.  I have prescribed Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., and enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d. She is also to take a multivitamin q.d.  I will see her again after the above test results to decide whether we need to adjust her medications.  I have increased her insulin to 28 units every morning.  She will come to see the nurse practitioner in three days' time to learn how to use a glucometer and to review diabetes care.  An electrocardiogram will be obtained and a consultation will be arranged with vascular surgery concerning the claudication now on the left leg.

CC:  right sided weakness

HPI:  The patient is a 70 year-old right-handed Dutch-speaking female with history of DM, PVD presenting to ED with right-sided weakness which started yesterday morning.  The patient's grand-nephew is translating, initially, then joined by Dutch interpreter; history is challenging to obtain.  The patient reports that since she awoke in the AM on 12/07/94, she noticed that her RUE and RLE was weak and numb.  She apparently had come to the ED about 2 days ago for RLE numbness and pain which has been worsening over the past 1-2 months, but reportedly had good strength on neurological exam, and she was not admitted.  She was given  a 2-day course of Levaquin for UTI.  She states that despite the pain in the RLE 2 days ago, she was able to move her RLE whereas since yesterday she has not been able to move it as easily or bear weight.  She also noted that her RUE was weak, and she was unable to raise it very far off the bed.  She was unable to walk independently since yesterday, and required full assistance of her son to walk to the bathroom.  She has had no facial weakness.  She has never had weakness of this kind in her right arm or leg, but had similar weakness in the left arm and leg in 2089 which completely resolved.  She states that she has had a mild right-sided headache since yesterday AM.  Since this morning, she has had nausea and vomiting as well (did not have this yesterday), and has not had any fevers or chest pain.  She has had SOB today. She reports having frequent BLE spasms, usually at night, and her legs become quite restless.

IX,X: 	voice normal, palate elevates symmetrically 

XI: 	SCM/trapezeii 5/5 bilaterally 

XII: 	tongue protrudes midline without atrophy or fasciculation 



Motor:	Normal bulk and tone; no tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia.  Unable to cooperate to test drift, but appears to have some difficulty raising right arm.  When right arm was passively raised by examiner, pt was able to maintain posture for several seconds without drift or tremor.  Moves LUE with ease for overhead movements; difficult to test against resistance due to pt cooperation/understanding of task.  Unable to elevate RLE off bed; elevates LLE only slightly off bed.  



Reflex:	Pt holding extremities tensely, unable to relax; appears to have 1+ for BUEs, unable to elicit patellar or ankle jerks.  Toe appears to be upgoing bilaterally but difficult exam.	 



Sensation:  	Inconsistent responses for BUE and BLE.  Subjectively decreased to LT on the RLE.   



Coordination:	manipulating objects without dysmetria LUE, less movement of the RUE.



Gait:	unable to test at this time due to pt feeling ill.

IMAGING:

CT head without contrast 12/08/94:

Prelim:  Mulitple regions of hypodensity in the subcortical white matter bilaterally, and in bilateral capsulothalamic regions as well as the left caudate/periventricular region.



MRI/MRA head and neck:

Not yet completed.



Recent MRI of L-spine 11/24/94:

The vertebral bodies, posterior elements, and alignment are

	intact.  Very prominent facet degeneration is seen on the right at

	L5-S1, and less prominently elsewhere.

	 

	There is straightening of the lumbar spine.

	 

	T12-L1, L1-L2, L2-L3, L3-L4:  Normal caliber canal and foramina.

	 

	L4-L5:  Mild broadbased bulge and facet hypertrophy is not

	associated with significant stenosis.

	 

	L5-S1:  Prominent facet hypertrophy as described with ligamentum

	hypertrophy and broadbased disk protrusion mildly narrows the

	central canal and mildly narrows each foramen.  There is narrowing

	of the lateral recesses on each side, and may be impingement of

	the traversing S1 nerve roots, more prominent on the right, as

	seen in images 17 and 18 of the axial sequence.



Old CT brain 6/16/89:

Mildly prominent ventricles and subarachnoid spaces are

	not uncommon for a patient of this age.  There are no regions of

	hypoattenuation within the brain to suggest a prior infarction.  Basal

	ganglia and basis pontis appear normal without evidence of lacunar

	infarction.  No significant periventricular white matter changes are

	evident.



_______________________________________________________________

IMPRESSION:  70 year-old right-handed female with h/o DM, PVD presenting to ED for RUE and RLE numbness and weakness, onset 12/07/94 AM.  She has had numbness/tingling and shooting pain in the RLE for the past 1-2 months likely due  to disease in the lumbar spine seen on MRI (L5-S1).  She states that the current weakness in the RLE is new, as is the weakness in the RUE.  Additionally, she has new nausea/vomiting and SOB since this AM.  While in the ED, following her CT scans, she was tachycardic to the 150s and hypertensive to the 230s systolic.  She had persistent nausea and vomiting.  



Her neurological exam was difficult with inconsistent findings.  She appears to have decreased spontaneous movement of the RUE, but when passively moved into shoulder flexion she was able to hold the position against gravity for several seconds.  Her RLE symptoms are likely confounded by her lumbar spine disease at L5/S1 as noted above.  She is hyperglycemic (serum glucose 313), has a mild leukocytosis, is iron deficient, and has new onset today of fairly severe nausea/vomiting and SOB of unclear etiology.  She appears to have vasculopathic changes/lacunes in the brain seen as hypodensities on the CT today, all appearing old.  She does not have any right facial weakness, no dysarthria, no aphasia, no flaccidity/spasticity, no gaze preference.  While stroke can not be ruled out, her exam does not clearly suggest a typical stroke syndrome.  Ddx includes seizure, infection or metabolic abnormality causing unmasking of stroke-like symptoms, migraine phenomena superimposed on current medical/metabolic abnormalities.





RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.	MRI/MRA of the head and neck (stroke protocol), as well as MRI of C-spine given UE symptoms

2.	We currently recommend admission to medicine given multiple medical issues (severe HTN, SOB as yet unexplained, N/V, hyperglycemia).

3.	BP control:  Labetolol to maintain BP less than 200 systolic; avoid large/rapid shifts to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.  Would allow some degree of hypertension (max 200 SBP) until stroke protocol MRI/MRA obtained.

4.	Glycemic control-need to clarify home insulin regimen

5.	Resend cardiac markers in setting of tachycardia to 150s

6.	F/u PE protocol CT (done in ED).

7.	Patient will be followed by the Neurology consult service.



This case was discussed with Dr. James Rosado MD, senior Neurology resident.

RE: TRENT, SHIRLEY
LCC #99210914
02/22/2096


Xitlalic Pearson, M.D.
Martha Washington Hospital
617 Comanche Street
Milbank, MN 49757   


Dear Dr. Pearson: 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Shirley Trent in follow up this morning. Mrs. Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman with a history of a left corona radiata stroke in December 2094 complicated by a dense right hemiparesis. She presented today with her granddaughter, Ms. Carey Trent. Ms. Trent translated and provided supplemental interval history.

Interval History
Mrs. Trent moved to the Eddie Bauer Nursing home approximately one month ago. She has continued to have a dense paresis of the right arm and leg, which has confined her to a wheelchair. She has had spasticity, in particular of the right leg, that has been painful at times and has contributed to sleeping difficulties. Baclofen was initiated and titrated to 20 mg TID, with some efficacy. According to Carey, another medication may have been used around the turn of the year. Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 100 mg HS on 2/10/96. 

Mrs. Trent related that she has had a depressed mood in recent months. A son with whom she was close died in August of last year from complications following an admission to the hospital with asthma. This was extremely difficult for Mrs. Trent. She has felt ""alone,"" but has enjoyed visits to the nursing home from Carey and from Carey's aunt, one of Mrs. Trent's daughters. Her other children have not maintained close contact.   

Mrs. Trent had increased weakness and slurring of her speech in early February, which may have been related to a urinary tract infection or sedating medication used at that time. Aside from that episode, Mrs. Trent reported no episodes of weakness, numbness, clumsiness, visual changes, slurred speech, dizziness, language difficulties, or other neurological symptoms concerning for stroke since her stroke in December 2094. 

Past Medical History
type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin
h/o peptic ulcer disease with GI bleeding 
hyperlipidemia 
peripheral arterial disease, bypass surgery on the right leg, mild symptoms of claudication on the left
left internal carotid artery stenosis

Medications (confirmed)
Baclofen 20 MG (10MG TABLET take 2) PO TID 
Clopidogrel 75 MG (75MG TABLET take 1) PO QD 
Gabapentin 100 MG (100MG CAPSULE take 1) PO QHS 
Metoclopramide HCL 10 MG (10MG TABLET take 1) PO AC 
Mirtazapine 30 MG (30MG TABLET take 1) PO QHS 
Multivitamin WITH FOLIC ACID (MULTIVITAMINS) 1 TAB PO QD x 60 days
Novolog (INSULIN ASPART) SC QAM, QPM and SS 
Omeprazole 20 MG (20MG CAPSULE DR take 1) PO QD 
Toprol XL (METOPROLOL SUCCINATE EXTENDED RELEASE) 100 MG (100MG TAB.SR 24H take 1) PO QD 

Allergies
NKA 

Social History
Mrs. Trent is originally from Suriname. She is widowed, with six living children. A son died at age 42 in August, 2095. Mrs. Trent has a remote history of smoking. She does not consume alcohol. She has recently spent much of her time watching television (like soap operas in Dutch) and participating in group activities (such as Bingo) at the home.  

Review of Systems
Negative for chest pain, shortness of breath, visual changes, weakness, numbness, burning pain, paresthesias, difficulties speaking or understanding others, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pain or burning on urination. Positive for frequent nighttime awakening. Appetite has been ""o.k.""

Exam
Blood Pressure 128/58     Heart Rate 76
Neck: no carotid bruits
Lungs: CTA bilaterally
Heart: regular rate and rhythm, II/VI systolic ejection murmur
ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds present
EXT: no edema
MS: alert, pleasant, cooperative, good eye contact. Fatigued, mildly depressed looking affect. Oriented to ""LCC"" in ""Galena,"" ""March 2095."" Speech fluent in Dutch. Followed 2-step verbal commands with left hand. Recalled recent events from soap opera episodes in detail. 
CN: pupils 4mm, round, LR to 2mm. EOMI. Mild right UMN facial weakness. Palate elevation symmetrical and tongue protrusion midline.
MOTOR: increased tone with clasp knife phenomenon right arm and leg. Minimal movement of right arm (elbow flexion, index finger extension, finger flexion) and right foot (knee flexion, ankle flexion, toe extension). 5/5 strength in proximal and distal muscles of the left arm and leg. 
SENSORY: reduced sensation to temperature and vibration right arm and leg relative to the left. 
DTRs: 3 in the right biceps, BR, triceps, 2 on the left. Trace patellar and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Right plantar response extensor, left flexor.
CEREB: no dysmetria left finger nose finger. 

MRI brain 12/10/94: small-to-medium sized stroke in the left corona radiata 

CTA head and neck 12/11/94: dense calcification at the carotid bifurcation, precluding a legitimate interpretation.

CNIS 12/14/94: demonstrated 25 to 49% stenosis in the proximal left ICA; velocity of 143 in the proximal ICA versus 50 in the distal CCA suggests a possible moderate (50-70%) stenosis of the vessel

Echocardiogram (transthoracic) 12/14/94: estimated EF of 55 to 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, mild left atrial enlargement, and no other significant abnormalities.

Impression
Mrs. Shirley Trent is a 71 year-old right-handed woman who had a stroke in the left corona radiata in December 2094. Her stroke risk factors include history of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, peripheral arterial disease, and left carotid stenosis with a calcified plaque. She has not had any clinical events suggestive of stroke in the interim between 11/94 and now. Mrs. Trent's current neurological and psychiatric problems include spasticity of the right arm and leg and depression. 

Plan
1. We will obtain repeat carotid studies to assess for interval progression of the left carotid stenosis.
2. We recommend continued management of vascular risk factors, with (1) target BP 120/80 or less, (2) target LDL < 100, (3) continued glycemic control. Continue clopidogrel as an antiplatelet agent.
3. Regarding the spasticity, it is reasonable to utilize a higher evening dose of gabapentin and assess the efficacy. Other potential agents to consider for future use include cyclobenzaprine, tizanidine, and trihexyphenidyl. I will continue to follow and would be happy to discuss this management with you at any time. 
4. I agree with mirtazapine for antidepressant therapy given Mrs. Trent's poor appetite and impaired sleep. After her gabapentin has been appropriately titrated, one may consider increasing mirtazapine to 45 mg HS.
5. Mrs. Trent will be scheduled for follow up in approximately 6 months.

It is a pleasure to participate in the care of Mrs. Trent with you. Greater than 50% of this 60 minute follow up visit was spent counseling regarding the above issues. Please do not hesitate to contact me with questions.


Sincerely,

EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. 1st degree AV block. Left axis deviation with likely left anterior fascicular block. No priors available for comparison.



Imaging:

Chest X-Ray: No evidence of pneumonia.



Hip films: Impacted, displaced fracture of the left femoral neck with longitudinal extension of fracture into the intertrochanteric proximal femur. 



TTE 6/77: Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.





Impression:

87F with PMHx of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, hypothyroidism, chronic venous stasis, and h/o post-op DVT presents with L proximal femur fracture after fall. Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history. Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure. Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital. Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history. This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.



Recommendations:

-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100

-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively

-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID

-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive



Thank you for this interesting consult. To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.

CHIEF COMPLAINT

fatigue, 9-point hct drop



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Carleson is a 87F w h/o HTN, HLP, DM, hypothyroidism, and now 2 weeks s/p left hemiarthroplasty after L femoral neck fracture who p/w fatigue at MEDIQUIK and was found to have an 8.5-point hct drop. 

In brief, pt was on her porch attempting to reach the doorknob of her front door, but failed to reach it and fell back landing sitting down.  She c/o of left femur pain and was unable to get up.  She denies hitting her head, CP, SOB.  She was found to have a displaced femoral neck fx on left and underwent an uneventful hemiarthroplasty; her post-op course was notable for Post-operative course was remarkable for LENIs on POD #2 found negative for DVT and 2-u pRBC transfusion for HCT of 23 with appropriate response.  She was discharged to MEDIQUIK on 7/2/77. 
On the day prior to admission (7/12), the pt was noted to be fatigued by the rehab staff; she recalls feeling tired but &#8220;not too bad.&#8221;  Her hct was noted to have dropped from 30.4 &#224; 24.6 (baseline post-op hct ~30).  She was sent to the MARY ED, where she was tachy to the 100s, sBP 120s, guiaiac negative, and xray/CT revealed 750 cc fluid extending from the proximal third of the thigh to the hip, with Houdsfield units suggesting hematoma.  Pt denies dyspnea, CP, lightheadedness, fever, chills, sweats.  She received 1 unit pRBC (increase hct from 24.6&#224;28) and was admitted to Educare-Fargo A for further management.  She received an add&#8217;l unit pRBC after arrival to the floor.

MICROBIOLOGY

Urine culture MEDIQUIK 7/10: &gt;100,000 mixed 3 organisms (contamination)



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES



Left hip xray (7/13): 
Status post left hip replacement. New bony fragment (since 6/29/77)

     superior to the left femur, likely from the greater trochanter



Left hip CT (7/13):  

1) heterogeneous density 6.6 x 8.9 cm intra-muscular soft tissue collection within the muscle planes in the left supero-lateral aspect of the left hip

2) smaller soft tissue collection within the subcutaneous fat anterolateral to the left hip measuring 4.7 x 7.9 cm

Impression: There at least two soft tissue collections are seen within the soft tissues surrounding the left total hip replacement, which have high density components likely representing hematomas.  The superior lateral collection appears intramuscular.  The inferolateral collection is within the subcutaneous fat.



TTE (6/2077): Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.



EKG

Irregular tachycardia with nml uniform appearing P-waves and narrow QRS; ?atrial tachycardia with variable block versus sinus tachycardia with dropped beats (similar pattern observed on EKG dated 6/29/77)

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

87F w h/o HTN, HLP, DM, hypothyroidism, and now 2 weeks s/p left hemiarthroplasty after L femoral neck fracture who p/w fatigue at MEDIQUIK and was found to have an 8.5-point hct drop. 




1) hct drop &#8211; likely post-op hematoma, unlikely other source of bleeding

- follow hct bid

- if pt c/o recurrent pain, or if exam changes, will obtain repeat hip xray

- transfuse if hct shows evidence of active bleeding (hct&lt;28 in AM) and symptomatic

- guaiac stools



2) s/p hemiarthroplasty

- WBAT per ortho

- PT consult for inpt assistance; maintain troch off precautions (no active abduction)

- f/u ortho recs from attending 7/14 AM



3) tachycardia &#8211; 2/2 anemia (resolving with stabilizing hct), volume depletion, post-op 

- follow telemetry

- replete lytes

- up-titrate beta-blocker if tachycardia persists on 7/14 following hct stabilization

- follow fever curve, CBC



4) heme

- started lovenox 30 mg bid on PM of 7/13 given risk of DVT (last anticoag 7/12 AM)

- d/w ortho re: risk of re-bleed versus risk of DVT



5) DM

- bid fingersticks, RISS if necessary



FEN: ADAT, D5NS at 80cc/hr for now



PPx

DVT: lovenox 30 bid for now

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn

CHIEF COMPLAINT

Fall



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

                Pt is an 88 yo woman with a PMH of DM, HTN, mild dementia and baseline anxiety with a hx of falls who was admitted following a witnessed mechanical fall which resulted in a Type III dens fracture and R superior/inferior pubic ramus fracture. 
She was seen by ortho, and they recommended use of an Aspen collar for the dens fracture, and no operative management for the pubic ramus fracture.  On 11/15, patient was noted to have a decreased Hct, which was attributed to an expanding hematoma on her right thigh, and she was given 2 U of PRBCs from 9:30am-5pm on 11/15.  Overnight her O2 requirement increased from 2L to 4L, and she was given Lasix in response to a chest X-ray which showed signs of pulmonary edema.  Throughout the day patient became progressively more agitated, and in addition to her standing Seroquel (12.5 mg bid), she was also given two doses of Zyprexa (2.5mg and 5mg).  Overnight on 11/15-11/16 she became febrile, up to 103.5, peaking at 105.6 in the morning on 11/16, despite standing Tylenol.  Blood cultures and urine cultures were taken, and patient was started on Levoquin, Vancomycin and Ceftriaxone, and transferred to Team E.

MICROBIOLOGY

Blood culture: No growth

Urine culture: No growth



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES

CXR

     IMPRESSION:

     

     Bilateral pulmonary edema, more prominent than 11/14/77



EKG

Initially unable to obtain because of pt&#8217;s tremor.  When more calm, EKG was irregular, no acute ST or T wave changes.

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

                88 yo female with a PMH of DM, HTN, severe anxiety and history of falls presenting with pubic ramus and dens fracture, now with new fevers, rigidity and tachycardia.



ISSUE #1: Fever and tremors.  Differential includes infection, seizure, NMS or serotonin syndrome.  A temperature of 105.6 with no obvious infectious source does make infection seem less likely, however patient will be treated empirically with vancomycin, ceftriaxone and levoquin for possible hospital acquired aspiration pneumonia or meningitis.  An LP will be attempted if it can be safely done without compromising the patient&#8217;s respiratory status, and in the context of the patient&#8217;s tremor.  In the context of recently receiving Seroquel, Zyprexa and Fluoxetine, it is also possible that patient could have either serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which could explain the patient&#8217;s elevated CK, elevated WBC, elevated LFTs, extremely high temperature and tremor with rigidity.


Continue to follow lytes, CK, CBC
 
Small doses of Ativan for tremor/anxiety
 
AVOID all neuroleptics (typical and atypical)
 
Continue antibiotics, F/U cultures



ISSUE #2: Type III Dens fracture and pubic rami fracture.


Keep in C collar, manage rami fracture medically



ISSUE #3: DM.  Continue FSGs and RISS.





ISSUE #4: Anemia.  Continue to follow Hct and monitor hematoma on R thigh



PROPYLAXIS

DVT: Teds, Pneumoboots

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn



CODE:  Full code (discussion continuing with family)

We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1. Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD. Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions. Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412

room emergently, became pale and diaphoretic and clammy with mild 

hypertension and an EKG showing an acute MI.  There is ST elevation 

in inferior leads and lateral leads and ST depression in anterior 

leads.  The patient was immediately given aspirin, beta blocker and 

heparinized as well as a nitro drip.  The second EKG showed some 

resolving of his ST elevation and ST depression.  His pain has 

subsided now to about a 1/10.  Blood pressure 102/56, pulse rate of 

58.  Chest x-ray, portable, was done and is also pending. 

Cardiology is aware.  The cath lab team has been called and has 

been mobilized immediately.  Medications that he has gotten so far 

are aspirin, morphine sulfate, nitro paste, sublingual 

nitroglycerine.  He is currently on an IV nitroglycerine drip. 

Three IV lines have been placed.  Portable chest x-ray done.  Cards 

fellow is here and the cath team is aware. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Only significant for hypertension. 

MEDICATIONS: Atenolol for his blood pressure medicine and recently 

put on quinine sulfate for pain in his legs. 

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Otherwise negative.  Never had any angina, never 

had an acute MI and never had any pain like this before.  He denies 

any interscapular pain and denies any other problems or 

complications at this point. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Lungs are clear.  Cardiac exam: No murmurs 

heard, no rubs or gallops.  No JVD, no bruits heard.  Abdomen is 

soft and nontender.  Rectal exam: Guaiac-negative with normal tone. 

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED: Currently in stable condition. 

Blood pressure normal.  Oxygen saturation 95% and a pulse rate of 

58.  He received 2.5 of Lopressor and is almost pain free at this 

point and doing well.  Seen by the cards fellow.  Cath lab team 

mobilized.  The patient is going to the cath lab. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS: Acute MI. 

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge): Family member has 

been called and message was left for his wife on her machine.  She 

is probably on the way to the hospital and we will inform her. 

Condition stable.

Ickes, Jr., William

02/02/79



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ickes comes in with pain in his right 

hip, left shoulder and for follow up of his coronary artery disease and 

his left wrist.  



His right hip continues to be painful at times.  A radiogram in December 

showed that he has osteoarthritis in that hip.  He has been taking 

Motrin twice a day and finds that he does get some relief with that.



His left shoulder has been bothering him for awhile but it is actually 

is somewhat better than it has been.  It hurts to abduct him more than 

90 degrees or to reach behind his back.



His left wrist is bothering him some now.  It is sore with most types of 

motion.



Regarding his diabetes, his blood sugar today was 190 early this 

morning.



Regarding his coronary disease, he has been walking every morning.  He 

has had no chest pain pressure or discomfort.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 110/70, weight is 192 pounds, 

pulse is 70 and regular.  He is a pleasant black man in no apparent 

distress.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.  Chest 

is clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiac, S1, S2, regular rate 

and rhythm, no murmurs or gallops.  Abdomen is soft.  Extremities, 

without edema.  Right hip, no pain with leg rolling.  Left shoulder is 

able to abduct to 90 degrees with no discomfort at all and is able to 

abduct completely with only minimal discomfort.  It is nontender to 

palpation.  Left wrist, he is a little tender over the medial joint 

line.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:



1.	Right hip:  I think he has degenerative joint disease and I want him 

to continue on the Motrin as needed.

	

2.	Left shoulder:  I may well have bursitis here.  He feels this has 

improved a lot and he would just as soon not do anything different 

for now but will let me know if it causes more problems.

	Page 2

	

3.	Left wrist:  He probably also has some arthritis in his left wrist.  

He is tender in the joint line today.  It is bothering him a little 

bit but not enough that he would like to do anything about it.

	

4.	Coronary disease:  He has been doing well from this prospective.  He 

has no recent chest pain, pressure or discomfort and his LDL has been 

very well controlled.

	

5.	Diabetes:  His last hemoglobin A1c was slightly elevated and we will 

check another one today.  I will have him follow up with Olga in 

PIMA regarding his diabetic control.

                                                       Patient Name: ROBISON,NEIL [ MRN: 013423CA ]

                                                         Date of Visit: 04/27/81









Mr. Robison comes to clinic today for f/u after being hospitalized for central pontine CVA in early April.  He has been working with OT, speech therapy and nutrition at home, with some improvement in gait and fine motor skills.  He still feels like his speech is poor and his right hand is not working at baseline.  Other complaints include a HA every morning which is global and tends to improve over the course of the day with tylenol.  He does admit to some visual changes that have been occuring for about one year--transient decreased vision in right eye, lasting for several minutes to hours and happening about twice per week.  He saw an ophthamologist in 12/02 who, per the patient, found no abnormalities.  He also states that he has had nonproductive cough with chest congestion for about 2 weeks. No fevers, chills, n/v or diarrhea.  Some rhinorrhea but no sinus sxs.  He has had difficulty with muscle cramps since his BMT which respond well to gatorade.  The nutritionist is not thrilled with the high salt content of gatorade.  We discussed the possibility of drinking less gatorade and adding a banana daily. 



MEDS:

lopressor 25 TID

coumadin 5 QHS



PE: 97.1   66   144/90, repeat 130/90    wt 225

gen: NAD, slightly dysarthric

neuro: CNII-XII intact except for slight right mouth droop; strength is 5/5 both upper and lower extremities; biceps and patellar DTRs 2+ symmetrically; gait is steady, but heel to toe is unsteady

CV: distant RRR without murmurs

Pulm: soft bibasilar crackles; no wheezes, rhonchi or areas of consolidation. no dullness to percussion

Skin: flaking over forehead and nasal bridge with slight redness

Rectal: erythema perirectally without bleeding or hemorrhoids. sl decreased rectal tone, no tenderness guaic neg brown stool







Labs: 4/22 INR 2.8

4/26: CBC, Chem 7, coags pending



A/P: 53 yo man with h/o lymphoma s/p allo BMT in 10/78 c/b chronic skin GVHD, pseudomonal pna and post herpetic neuralgia who was recently hospitalized with central pontine CVA.  Trans thoracic echo, spiral CT and carotid ultrasound did not reveal embolic source.  MRI showed right MCA cut off with collateral flow.  His sxs of dysarthria and right hand dysfunction seem to be slowly improving with OT, speech therapy. Daily HA are concerning.  

--repeat head CT to rule out progression of infarct or bleed into infarct territory. Pt may need another MRI in future, but is wary of MRI and may require open machine

--pt has neuro follow up at the end of May.  We need to discuss with the neurologist the duration of anti-coagulation

--check coags, CBC, Chem 7 today; adjust coumadin prn

--increase lopressor to 50 BID and continue BP monitoring by VNA

--pt has f/u with his primary oncologist Dr. Savage at RGSC on 5/6. 

--no abx at this time for cough without focal pulm findings and abscence of fever. Follow closely

--have asked pt to make another ophtho appt to eval visual changes in right eye (which apparently have been happening for a year and have not been progressive)

--RTC in 3 weeks to review CT results and lab tests.

Re:   Neil Robison  #371-97-98



Dear Wilcox,



     I saw Mr. Robison today. I hadn't seen him since last year.  I'm very pleased to see how well he's done.  He has had no double vision, no staggering, and no numbness around the mouth.  His speech is a little slurred he says (unchanged).  He walks with a wide-based gait, but is otherwise steady on his feet.  There is no tremor.  His arms and legs are strong.  Extraocular movements are full.  The pupils are equal.  There is no ptosis.  His speech is fluent.



     He takes one aspirin a day as well Lipitor and some vitamins (the other medicines he doesn't recall but I think you are in the know about).  



     His blood pressure is 120/80.  The pulse is around 76.  There are no cervical bruits.  



     From my perspective he is doing well on the aspirin and we should sit tight.  I would like to see him again in a year and at that time we should have our Dopplers again to recheck the flow in the basilar artery. The right vertebral is dominant and the left is occluded.  The left MCA stem was hard to visualize on the imaging.  It may well be occluded with collateralization. The left imaging was in 2082.  He is stable at this time.  He knows to call if he develops any symptoms.



Best regards,





G. Kevin Yawn, M.D.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Neil comes in today to follow up on multiple medical issues, the first of which is his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He states that since beginning the Flomax that we started him on in January, his symptoms are at least 50% better.  He is only getting up once per night to go to the bathroom and is not having any hesitancy or difficulty passing his urine.  He is also following up on his elevated cholesterol, his hypertension.  He states that he has been trying to follow a better diet, but does state that he has not been particularly good about getting regular exercise.  He is also following up on his diabetes.  He is not having any difficulty with his medications.  He did not schedule his colonoscopy that I had referred him for in January but states that he would be willing to do so after the spring.  He is also following up on his COPD.  He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis.  He states that his breathing has been good.  He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.  He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.  A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.  He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting.  He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.

MEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection.  The oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities show no edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.  He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.  He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.
2.  BPH.  We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.  Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.
3.  Hypertension.  This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.  If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.
4.  COPD.  Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.  He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.
5.  Elevated cholesterol.  His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.  If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.
6.  Abnormal liver function tests.  These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.  It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.  Follow up with me is in one month.

PRESENTING COMPLAINT and HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 
patient was evaluated in conjunction with a resident.  Briefly, the 
history is as follows:  This patient is a 54-year-old black male 
with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, who presents 
with acute, severe substernal chest pain.  This pain began 
approximately five hours prior to presentation, but accelerated 
within the previous one to two hours.  It is accompanied by 
diaphoresis, but not by shortness of breath or nausea.  The patient 
does have a history of prior CVAs, but no history of previously 
documented cardiac disease. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the patient is in 
acute, severe distress.  He is diaphoretic and somewhat pale.  The 
vital signs are as recorded in the Nurses' Notes but are stable 
initially.  The HEENT examination shows the sclerae to be 
anicteric.  The oropharynx is somewhat dry.  The neck is supple, 
without venous distention.  The breath sounds are clear 
bilaterally.  The heart shows a regular rate and rhythm with 
somewhat distant tones, without discrete murmur.  The abdomen is 
slightly obese and soft throughout, without tenderness.  The 
extremities show no discoloration or edema. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The electrocardiogram shows an acute 
anterior myocardial infarction.  Other laboratory studies are 
pending at this time.  A chest x-ray has been obtained, though it 
has not been processed at the time of this dictation. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was treated with 
aspirin and nitroglycerin en route.  He was started on a 
nitroglycerin drip, which was incrementally increased to 80 
micrograms per minute.  He was given morphine sulfate in 2 mg 
increments to a total of 10 mg.  He was given 5000 units of 
intravenous heparin.  He was given 2.5 mg of intravenous Lopressor. 
The Cardiology Service is here with the patient and he is being 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for immediate 
angioplasty. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Myocardial infarction. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  As above. 
Please see the handwritten record for further details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This pleasant 62-year-old African American 
gentleman returns to my clinic today for follow-up of diabetes, status 
post MI, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

1.  He brings in his blood sugar values with him today.  These are 
improved since his last visit, and somewhat more believable ranging from 
128 to 195, predominantly higher in the evenings more than the mornings 
ranging from 150 to 190.  He is currently on a somewhat odd regime of 6 
units of insulin regular twice a day, with a large 24 units of insulin 
at night, and 14 units insulin in the morning.  He has not had any 
further hypoglycemic attacks, is having no nocturnal awakening, and 
seems to be sticking more to the diet.  He has however gained some 
weight, which is a little disconcerting.  He does attend a podiatrist 
and is doing well from that perspective.  He is to return to the 
ophthalmologist for further diabetic screening later on in the year.  He 
missed his last nutrition appointment and is not interested in further 
follow-up with nutrition at this time.
2.  Cardiovascular.  He is on atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperglyceridemia, 
atenolol 25 mg, and aspirin.  Further question regarding his stroke back 
in 2061 shows that this presents with confusional episode with 
unsteadiness, resolving after approximately 36 hours, and he was found 
to have a hole in his heart at that time.  He was eventually stopped off 
Coumadin in 2063, but had a recurrent episode at that time and he was 
put on Coumadin for life at that point.  He had an aborted myocardial 
infarction in 2067.  He has had no chest pain in the interim, has good 
exercise tolerance with walking, although, he can only run about 50 
yards before getting very short of breath.  He has no orthopnea or PND.  
He has no chest pain or use of sublingual nitro.
3.  Health maintenance.  We discussed screening colonoscopy versus 
flexible sigmoidoscopy and the relative benefit of each of those.  He 
has agreed to proceed with colonoscopy, and I have instructed him stop 
his Coumadin and aspirin five days before the test and to have an INR 
checked on the day prior to the test.  This will be scheduled by our 
secretary.  He will restart the Coumadin after the colonoscopy at his 
standard dose and titrate up slowly.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Include aspirin, atenolol, insulin, Coumadin, and 
Lipitor.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 148/82.  He is tachycardic 
at 98 beats per minute.  Examination of his eyes shows persistent left-
sided cataract.  Examination of the heart and lungs was normal.  The 
abdominal examination is also normal.  His injection sites were clean 
and without erythema.  There is no evidence of peripheral neuropathy and 
his feet appeared well.

We spent some time today talking about diabetes education again, 
including appropriate foods, drinks, and what items to avoid.

PLAN:
1.  Supplied educational materials regarding diabetes management, 
including calorie counting, weight loss, information about hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia, and diabetic eye care.
2.  I have increased insulin in the mornings from 14 to 16 units and 
left the other doses as is.
3.  I have increased the atenolol from 25 mg to 50 mg for hypertension 
and cardioprotection with the tachycardia.
4.  We will check cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, CBC, and chem-7.
5.  I have scheduled an elective outpatient colonoscopy as detailed 
above for colorectal cancer screening.
6.  Return to see in a week's time, understands.  He can discuss any 
management issues regarding his insulin doses or others anytime.

Notes


Reason for consult: Acute on chronic renal failure


HPI: 65 y/o man with PMH of stage IV CKD, HTN, CAD, RAS, DM, who was admitted to the CCU on 1/26 after an episode of bradycardia and PEA arrest at home.  Pt was found by his wife yesterday to be complaining of severe chest pain and SOB.  She called EMS.  Upon arrival of EMS, pt was in respiratory distress and bradycardic with a HR in the 20s.  He was intubated.  He subsequently became puloseless and asystolic and was coded for about 10 minutes with 3 rounds of epinephrine and atropine before he regained his pulse.  In the ED, his BP was 230/120 and he was started on a nitro gtt.  He was noted to have blood in his OG tube.  CXR showed bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary edema.  Chest CT showed multiple rib fractures with substernal hematoma and bilateral modest pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis vs consolidations.


On admission, pt&#8217;s BUN and creatinine were 43 and 4.35, respectively.  He was started on a lasix gtt for diuresis without a good response.  His Cr started to rise: 4.6 &#224; 4.9 &#224; 5.4 &#224; 5.33 &#224; 6.3 &#224; 7.0.  His urine output continued to be poor, and renal consult was called.

The estimated ejection fraction is 55-60% with beat-to-beatvariation. There are no regional wall motion abnormalities. Echocardiographic assessment is consistent with normal diastolic function. Nl RV, mild LAE, Mild RAE, mild to moderate MR with an eccentric laterally-directed jet, mild to moderate TR, w/estimated PASP 24.


A/P: 66M with MMP including HTN, CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD, AF, and h/o PEA arrest who presents for routine follow up after recent bleeding AVF admission and ED visits.


#. CV: BP well controlled today, but in the absence of his wife it is entirely unclear what medications he is taking.  We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem.  It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring.  I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now.
       - F/u with Dr. Vest
       - Follow INR
       - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife


#. Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3/30/97 unless changed over wire at HD.  He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump. His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).  


#. GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load/genotype have not been able to be determined.  It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past.  We will continue to follow HCV viral  load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology.  His synthetic function is mostly preserved.  #. DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen.  Last A1C was 6.0, and with recent evidence we will continue his current regimen.
  
#. OSA: Sleep study completed, qualifies for CPAP, and using with good effect.  


#. Other: Repeat utility letter

risks of HTN and knows that it is very common among African Americans.  Will
follow this issue closely and readdress at next visit.

HARDY,TERESA   360-52-41-3                    VISIT DATE: 12/03/75

This patient was seen concurrently with Dr. Jeter, whose note I 

have reviewed and with which I agree. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 56-year-old female who 

presents with complaints of chest pain.  The patient has a known 

history of coronary artery disease and most recently had a stent 

placed in April of 2075.  The patient had an episode of chest 

tightness with dyspnea while walking to catch a bus.  The patient 

states that this is unusual for her.  She does not usually have 

discomfort with exertion since having her stent placed.  That did 

resolve with rest and now the patient states she had a just ""trace"" 

of chest tightness throughout the day otherwise.  The patient came 

to Abbeville General Hospital and while walking uphill towards 

the hospital entrance she had recurrence of her discomfort.  The 

patient is pain-free on arrival to the emergency department.   

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per the written note. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 

angioplasty, stent, coronary artery disease, pulmonary 

hypertension. 

MEDICATIONS:  Glyburide, aspirin, Lasix, and otherwise as per the 

written note.

ALLERGIES:  Actifed.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  This is a well-developed, well-nourished 

female in no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.9, pulse 

87, respiratory rate 20, blood pressure 161/93.  Oxygen saturation 

is 98% on room air.  HEENT:  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils are 

equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular 

motions are intact.  LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  No 

crackles.  No wheezes.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  Regular rate and rhythm.  

Physical exam is otherwise as per the written note.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION: Labs are significant for an EKG which shows 

a sinus rhythm at 87 beats per minute.  There are 1-mm ST 

depressions in leads V5 and V6.  This was compared to a prior EKG 

from July 2075 and was found to be without significant change.  The 

only new change on the EKG is that a previously biphasic T-wave in 

V4 is now upright.  Glucose is 215, BUN 21, creatinine 1.1, sodium 

140, potassium 3.9, chloride 100, bicarb 32, CK 321, MB 3.1, trauma 

0.07, calcium 9.4, white count 8.8, hematocrit 40.1, platelets 247, 

PT 11.3, PTT 25.0.  Urinalysis shows no blood, no leukocyte 

esterase, no nitrates.  Chest x-ray shows no infiltrate, no 

pulmonary edema.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was seen and evaluated 

in the emergency department with labs and studies obtained as 

documented above.  The patient's history is concerning for angina.  

The patient received an aspirin, as well as Lopressor, while in the 

emergency department.  She has remained pain-free throughout her 

period of observation while in the emergency department.  The 

patient will require serial cardiac enzymes due to her most recent 

chest discomfort being en route to the hospital and if these are 

unremarkable the patient will require a functional cardiac study 

such as an exercise tolerance test. 

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Angina.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted to the hospital in satisfactory condition.

1. DMT2:  HGA1C 13 6/2078.  Will d/c glyburide, and start metformin 500 mg po BID. Advised her to not take AM dose  the morning of the eye surgery and may resume PM dose  prior to supper that evening. She understands. Hopefully with  BID dose her DM will be better controlled, particularly in afternoon.  AlkPhos 124 mildy  elevated 6/2078 but normalized now and should be fine  with metformin.  New script for metformin given.

RE: EGAN, VAL
MRN: 8268084
DOB: 07/30/2063


Dear Dr. Rucker, 


I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Val in the office today. As you recall, he is a very pleasant 71-year-old gentleman with a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia. He has pain behind the right eye that has been present for 3 years. He describes it as a very sharp, severe, stabbing pain. He takes Tegretol, which helps but does not completely alleviate the pain. Over the past month the pain has become worse and increasingly intolerable. He has increased his Tegretol dose to 800 mg per day, which is about the limit of what he can tolerate. 


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, asthma. 


MEDICATIONS: Levothyroxine, Lyrica, Tegretol, glyburide and metformin. 


ALLERGIES: None. 


PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Cholecystectomy. 


SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient is retired, a laboratory technician and lives in cincinnati.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Noncontributory. 


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Revealed a pleasant, older man in mild distress secondary to the pain. His mental status, cranial nerve examination, strength and sensation were normal. 


IMPRESSION AND PLAN: In summary, this is a patient with what seems to be right V1 trigeminal neuralgia. The fact that he responded to the Tegretol is encouraging. I discussed the different options with him including no surgery, radiofrequency rhizotomy, and microvascular decompression. He elected to proceed with a microvascular decompression. I discussed the risks and benefits of the procedure with the patient and all his questions were answered. A surgical consent was obtained. The plan is to perform the surgery on 08/31/2135. Prior to proceeding, I would like to obtain a dedicated brain MRI with fine cuts through the posterior fossa to better assess the neurovascular anatomy. 


I thank you very much and look forward to hearing from you in the future.

History of Presenting Illness
Mr. Egan is a 72 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Type II DM. Two weeks ago, he noted intermittent episodes of exertional dyspnea. He was started on albuterol and advair with no improvement. On 08/30/2135, he experienced worsening exertional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. He sought medical attention at Natchaug Hospital ED. An initial ECG revealed Q waves in V1-V4. He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. 
On 08/31/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09/02/2135. 
On 09/03/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery.

	Reason for visit:
   72 y.o. admit s/p cardiac catherization revealing patent LAD stent


	Interval History:
   72 year old male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, and CAD. He sufferred a NSTEMI on 8/30/35. A cath at that time revealed an occluded mid LAD lesion, a 75% ostial OM2 stenosis, a 90% OM4 stenosis, and a non-dominant RCA with a 90% stenosis. His LVEF was estimated at 25-30% with moderate MR. He was discharged home on 9/02/35 to orbit for future CABG. 
9/03/35 He was admitted to Natchaug Hospital secondary to recurrent rest pain. n 9/04/35 Echo revealing moderate MR with no other significant valvular abnormalities. There was segmental left ventricular dysfunction involving the septal, apical, inferior, and anterior territories. EF 55%.  There was segmental right ventricular dysfunction involving the apex. The plan was for this patient to undergo CABG; however the patients wife was involved in a serious MVA, and with further discussion the decision was made to take him to the cath lab to attempt PCI so that the patient could be with his wife as soon as possible. 
9/05/35 He was taken to the CCL. mid LAD had a 100% occlusion after the D1. The D1 was a small vessel with an ostial, eccentric, 90% lesion. The OM2 had a 60% eccentric lesion that did not appear flow limiting. The LPDA had a 95% complex lesion in the proximal third. He underwent stenting of the native mid LAD with a  Xience OTW 2.5 X 23mm stent with an excellent result. This was followed by kissing-balloon angioplasty of the ostium of the 1st diagonal and the LAD. The pre-intervention stenosis was 90% with 0% residual stenosis. Finally, stenting of the proximal third of the left PDA was performed using a Xience V 2.5 x 15mm and a 2.5 x 12mm stent. The pre-intervention stenosis was 95% with 0% residual stenosis. At the end of the case, there was TIMI III flow throughout with no perforation or dissection. The patient remained stable throughout the rest of the admission with no further chest discomfort. He was discharged home on 9/06/35. 

Since his discharge he has noticed that he was dyspneic with lying flat. He has also noticed some exertional fatigue and dyspnea. He presented to Natchaug Hospital for further evaluation.  His ECG showed no acute changes, CXR consistent with mild CHF.  He has been aggressively diuresed with improvement  in his level of dyspnea. He was transferred to GCH for a repeat cardiac catheterization. 
Cath today revealing:  Widely patent LAD and LPDA stents. Balloon angioplasty site of proximal D1 patent. Nondominant RCA with 90% proximal lesion Severe cardiomyopathy with mid-distal anterior, apical, and mid-distal inferior hypokinesis. EF 25% with LVEDP 20. Moderate mitral regurgitation.

ENDOCRINE/DIABETES STAFF CONSULTATION

Patient: VAUGHN, FRANK			MANAMANA MRN: 6767510
Requesting MD: Dr. Quale			Service: SICU

CC/ID: Asked to see this 33 y/o M admitted with Fourier's gangrene, s/p multiple surgical procedures, for DM management

HPI/ROS: Pt is a 33 y/o with DM-2 who was in his USH until about 2 weeks PTA, when he developed buttock pain.  He had some purulent D/C from rectum and worsening of glucose control.  He was seen in EDUCARE-PULLMAN Urgent Care on 1/21/77 at which time a small erythematous and tender cyst was noted between his buttocks.  He was prescribed sitz baths and Keflex for pilonidol cyst vs. ruptured boil.  He was seen again in EDUCARE-PULLMAN on 1/29/77 at which time he reported resolution of his buttock pain.  He denied fevers or neurologic symptoms.  Exam was notable for only a tiny pustule in the upper gluteal cleft, minimally erythematous, non-tender, without drainage.  On the morning of 2/01/77 he developed worsening of his shortness of breath, followed by the development of left jaw pain, and cold sweats, so he presented to the MANAMANA ED.  On presentation, he also admitted to three days of scrotal and perineal pain and swelling.  In the ED he was tachycardic to 113, normotensive, initially low-grade fever, but later spiked to 102.9.  On examination, there was severe bilateral testicular swelling and pain, with a fluctuant mass between the rectum and scrotum.  His WBC was 18,000 with 91% PMNs.  An abdominal CT revealed extensive subcutaneous edema in the perineum, with multiple foci of air consistent with a necrotizing infection; and extensive fluid in the scrotum, consistent with Fournier's gangrene.  The patient was treated with IV Abx and was taken urgently to the OR, where he underwent extensive debridement at which time substantial necrosis and pus were discovered.  He was admitted to the SICU and has since undergone multiple debridements, last on 2/20/77.

In terms of his DM, he has type 2 diagnosed in October 2075.  At the time he was feeling ""lousy,"" tired, nauseated, and increased urinary frequency: went to Payson Hospital and FS was 376.  Pt was admitted overnight and given insulin; started on Metformin 500 bid, eventually insulin was added.  He was being followed by Dr. Talley at the Promptcare but stopped going there.  Most recently treated with Lantus 50 units at bedtime plus maximal doses of Glipizide 10 bid and Metformin 1000 bid, with uncontrolled HbA1c (see below).  He has microalbuminuria.  He is unable to give me a full history.

In the SICU he has been treated with an insulin drip, which oscillates between 4-11 U/hr.  He is being fed with Glucerna continuous TF at 120 cc/hr, and has been started on NPH 50 U q12h.

Impression:  33 y/o M with DM-2 requiring insulin, uncontrolled PTA, here recovering from Fournier's gangrene, still in ICU with multiple IV Abx and being fed with TF, requiring high doses of insulin both IV and SQ.

Pt's insulin requirement is very large due to 1) marked insulin resistance secondary to obesity, 2) ongoing infection and critical illness, and 3) enteral TF.

Would maintain on insulin drip while titrating NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed.  Considering his current requirement of at least 120 U IV/24h on top of his SQ doses, he will probably need close to 100 U q12h.  Could safely increase his NPH to 80 U q12h right now.

Would make sure that in the Instructions to this order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose if that happens.

Recommend:
1. Increase NPH to 80 U q12h
2. Titrate NPH doses upwards by 10 U q12h each dose as long as czi drip is needed
3. Please make sure that in the Instructions to the NPH order it's written to hold NPH if TF stop for any reason, and start D10W @ 50 cc/hr for 12h after the last NPH dose (especially if pt transfers to floor)
4. Would consider reintroducing ACEi for kidney protection into his BP regimen (e.g. Lisinopril 10 mg daily)
5. Pt will likely need fibrate for hypertriglyceridemia as he improves

Thank you for interesting consult
Dr. Tan will follow

MANAMANA  MEDICAL  CONSULT  NOTE
PATIENT:  Vaughn, Frank R.
MANAMANA MR#:  6767510
PCP:  Henry Jenkins, M.D. (503 155-7742)
PSYCH:  Brittany Prince, M.D.
CONTACT:  Mother, Haley Vaughn (158 857-4114)
SOURCE:   Patient; M.D. Passoff; Previous Medical Records
PRECAUTIONS:   MRSA; VRE
PRIMARY SERVICE:  Psychiatry Service (Internal Medicine)
CONSULT DATE:   6/19/77
TIME:   2:00 PM
CC:  Suicidal ideation
REASON for CONSULT:  Evaluation for history of medical problems


HPI:  Pt is a 33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.  Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.  


The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.


The Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service.

ASSESSMENT
33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.  Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.  His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.  He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.  His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.  His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
2. Continue NPH Insulin 30 units with breakfast and 10 units with dinner.  If pt is NPO, or refusing to eat a meal, please give only one-half the dose
3. Continue his regular insulin sliding scale as outline in the Medication List with QAC and QHS fingerstick checks
4. No concentrated sweets diet
5. Start Lisinopril 10mg PO once daily
6. Start Lopid 600mg PO BID (30 minutes before breakfast and dinner)
7. Consider checking hemoglobin A1c and fasting lipid profile with reflex check of LDL for triglyceridemia
8. Dry sterile dressing changes to his scrotal and sacral wounds TID and PRN if dressing is soaked
9. Will defer antidepressive medication regimen to Psychiatry Service


Case and plan discussed in detail with Medical Consult Attending, Dr. Hector Bennett.

Abdominal wound cx pending


Studies:  CXR:  Lung fields clear, no evidence of pneumonia. 


CT abd/pelvis:There is mild inflammatory fat stranding, heterogeneity, and slightly increased vascularity involving the anterior abdominal wall, extending in to the scrotum without evidence of drainable fluid collection or air pockets. Mild induration and thickening of the overlying skin of the abdominal wall is also noted. Stable postsurgical scar in the right anterior abdominal wall. Surgical sutures in the anterior abdominal wall. There is a superficial soft tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior abdominal wall, slightly larger on the current study measuring approximately 3.3 cm. There are mild degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.


Procedure note: The area of induration on the left side of the patient&#8217;s pannus was prepped with betadine. 5cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was infiltrated into the area. A 2cm incision was made over the area of fluctuance and approximately 8cc of purulent thick fluid was expressed. A culture of the abscess fluid was sent. The wound was probed gently to break up any loculations. The wound was then packed with &#188; inch dry packing tape. A dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. 


Impression/Plan: 33 year old diabetic male with history of Fournier&#8217;s gangrene s/p multiple debridements and diverting colostomy presents with recurrent cellulitis and abscess of the left side of his pannus. The abscess was drained and packed in the ED. The patient will be admitted for IV antibiotics and careful monitoring of his cellulitis.

 BMH Senior Health Initial Visit

CC: 79 yo man hx depression, psychosis, insomnia, CAD, syncope, HTN, DMT2, carotid stenosis, PVD, here for PCP and f/u of these and other chronic health problems

HPI: Patient recently presented to BMH with syncope s/p standing abruptly leading to left forhead lac. No seizure activity. He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month. 
Concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma. He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf. WMA and LA dilation. Cardiology was therefore consulted. An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf. lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV. The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic. An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21. Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.
    
In hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months. Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention. Endocrine w/u included nl TSH and cortstim. The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess. SPEP and BNP wnl and; his PSA was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal. The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen. 
   
Just prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts (""I lost my mortal soul""). Psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolonged
hospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions. It was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.

Hospitalization done on Psych floor. Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy. The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell. He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him. He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead. He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.
           
On the inpt ward, Mr. Shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qHS. Cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qDay with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood.  The patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to Remeron 15mg. At the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression.  He further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to  challenge this belief ""most of the time.

Neuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment. He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention. He had very poor learning of new information.      
     
Pt was discharged to home with an intake appointment in the Jones Hospital
Psychiatry scheduled for the following day.

He has since followed up with Frances Talley, where Zyprexa dose slowly tapered to decrease grogginess.

Plan:
1. Depression: Continues on Remeron and CYmbalta. Encouraged not to completely d/c Cymbalta just b/c is feeling better. Dr. Nobles to follow. Appears willing to take Remeron as he feels it helps him with sleep.

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	BAPTIST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
	


	Reason for visit:
   coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of syncope


	Interval History:
   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.  

To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.  They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.  He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes. These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.   

His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.  A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.  The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.  During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.  He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.  Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks. 

Today, he presents with no acute complaints.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.  He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.  His claudication is at his baseline.  He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a ""tired"" sensation in both legs.  He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.  Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

IDENTIFICATION:  A 65-year-old woman presents as a new patient to discuss problems with leg swelling.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

1.  Longstanding insulin-dependent adult onset diabetes with a history of neuropathy and retinopathy.

2.  History of lower extremity edema with past evaluation per patient including a normal stress echocardiogram.

3.  History of low back pain due to degenerative disc disease.  The patient has been treated at the Bryan W Whitfield Memorial Hospital  with treatments including facet blocks and epidural injections.

4.  Status post cholecystectomy.

5.  Status post four vaginal deliveries, two cesarean sections and two miscarriages.

8.  Hypothyroidism.

9.  Former smoker approximately 15-pack-year history quit seven years ago.

10.  Hypertension.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient has a longstanding history of diabetes.  She has required retinal laser surgery for retinopathy.  She reports some tingling and numbness in the bottom of her feet.  She has had debilitating problems with lower extremity swelling over the last 18 months.  She notes that an extensive evaluation was initially done without a clear explanation.  Her endocrinologist had her stop her Actos which resulted in significant improvement.  Over the last six months, however, the patient has developed leg swelling again.  She denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  She does note some exertional shortness of breath, which she attributes to her weight.  She has no history of exertional chest pain.  She has not noted a change in her abdominal girth.  She has had no calf pain or swelling.  She does note a history of sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome.  The patient notes that she had a sleep study at some point in the past two or three years ago.  A CPAP device was recommended but not tolerated by the patient.  She notes that she has significant daily low back pain.  Her average pain is 8-9/10.  This occurs while she is standing or walking any distance.  She has very little or no pain when she is sitting or lying.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, unremarkable with no fever, chills, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, black or bloody stools, dysuria, skin rash.  The patient does have exertional leg cramps.  She notes a vascular evaluation was normal and her pain was felt due to her back.



MEDICATIONS:  Norvasc 5 mg q.d., Bextra 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg q.d., lisinopril 40 mg q.d., atenolol 50 mg q.d., Flonase one spray each nostril q.d., quinine 324 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., aspirin 81 mg q.d., insulin, Humulin N 40 units b.i.d., Humalog sliding scale 15 to 25 units q.a.m. 15 to 25 units before dinner, levothyroxine 150 mcg q.a.m.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Weight 284 pounds, temperature 98.2, heart rate 68, blood pressure 140/64.  The patient is in no distress, breathing comfortably.  HEENT: Anicteric, no oral lesions.  Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy, no thyroid mass or nodule.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation.  No wheeze, rales or rhonchi.  Cardiac: Regular.  Distant heart sounds.  No murmur, rub or gallop.  Abdomen: Obese, soft, no mass.  Normoactive bowel tones.  Extremities: 2+ edema to the knees.  Vascular: Carotid pulses are strong and symmetric without bruit.  Radial, dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are strong and symmetric.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.  Edema.  The patient's edema is likely multifactorial.  She does not have evidence of congestive heart failure today.  I reviewed her dietary sodium intake, which sounds to be acceptable.  She may benefit from additional nutrition counseling regarding this issue.  Her leg swelling may also relate to her Norvasc use.  I did not see her urine microalbumin testing and laboratory studies the patient brings with her today.  Significant proteinuria may be contributing to her edema as well.  The patient has had no reactions to sulfa medications and has never been on a thiazide diuretic to her knowledge.  I recommended initially that she stop the Norvasc and start hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d.  I discussed the use and side effects of this medication.  I will see her back in the office in two or three weeks to review her progress.

2.  Low back pain. I recommend the patient continue her Bextra.  We discussed other pain medications including narcotics.  We elected against using these medications today.

3.  History of sleep apnea.  The patient has significant fatigue.  This may be due to her sleep apnea.  In addition, her difficulty with her weight as well as fluid retention may relate to her poorly controlled sleep apnea.  I discussed this with her today.  I would recommend that she return for a follow up sleep study.  She did not have good luck with a sleep mask but might do better with a nasal mask.  She will think about this and we will review it again on her follow up visit.

Impression

My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W. She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother"" coverage



Recommendation

My recommendations are:

1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO

2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO

3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale

Xian, Brooklyn 
602-44-98-6


She was last in the clinic on October 24, 2063.  She comes in today with her husband and daughter.  (Her daughter is her legal healthcare proxy.)  They come in to follow up on a recent hospitalization at Mid Coast Hospital.  In January, she was noted by her family to be agitated and confused.  She was missing her medication or taking too much medication at times, including her insulin.  She also became paranoid when efforts were made to intervene to assist her.  Her family notes that this seemed to begin after her gabapentin dose was increased to 600 mg bid.  She was also taking some other drugs at the time that affect the central nervous system, including trazodone, benzodiazepines, and narcotics for back pain.  She was admitted to the geriatric psychiatry unit at Mid Coast in January 2065.  She stayed there for almost a week.  According to the family, some medications were discontinued and donepazil was started.  Also, they think she had a brain MRI.  She improved and was ultimately discharged.  She has done much better since discharge.  She went with family to Michigan.  They report that there she was much better, playing water volleyball last week.  Her husband is now supervising her medications.  He still notices some memory loss, but this has improved since her discharge.  She has had frequent headaches.  She has noted no urinary incontinence and no worsening of her gait.


According to available notes, drugs stopped during her hospitalization include gabapentin, trazodone, metformin, HCTZ, Hunulin, and Lispro.  She is back no the metformin and HCTZ.


Her current medications are: aspirin 81 mg daily, Celebrex, donepazil 5 mg daily, HCTZ, linsinopril, labetalol, Crestor, insulin, pramipexole 0.125 mg qhs, Protonix, Roxicet, L-thyroxine, temazepam qhs, and metformin.  She is allergic to erythromycin.


On examination today pulse is 60 and regular.  BP is 104/60.  She is alert and oriented to time, except the precise date.  She is aware that yesterday was Tuesday.  She is oriented to place.  Her mental and motor responses are slightly slow.  She displays an appropriate sense of humor.  She attends well.  She recites the months of the year promptly forwards and backwards. She registers 4 of 4 words.  She recalls 3/4 at one minutes and the 4th with a semantic clue with a slight error ""14 Massachusetts Drive"" rather than 24 Massachusetts Drive.  At 5 minutes, she recalls all 4 with only the error, ""14 Massachusetts Drive"" but with no need for a clue.  At 10 minutes, she recalls 2/4 without any clue, the 3rd with a semantic hint, and the 4th with a semantic hint again as ""14 Massachusetts Drive.""  She readily adds a simple sum in her head.  She follows multiple step commands.  She copies interlocking pentagons and a 3D cube well with only slight 3D perspective distortion.  She constructs a clock well with good planning and no neglect.  


Visual fields are full.  Pupils are 2.5 mm and reactive.  Fundi are not well visualized.  There rest of the cranial nerves are intact.  Muscle bulk, tone, and power are normal.  There are not extrapyramidal features, and there is no paratonia.  Reflexes are damp in the arms and absent at the ankles (UE 1/4, knees 2/4, ankles 0/4) and symmetric.  Plantar responses are flexor.  Romberg is negative.  She walks without hesitation in gait initiation.  Her stride is reasonably good,  Her base is only slightly widened.  She tandem walks with moderate unsteadiness.  


The examination has not changed much from her visit in October 2063.  She has some problems with memory by examination, but this seems to have improved greatly since her hospitalization.  Her confusion and reported paranoia seem to have gone away. Except or mild psychomotor slowing, she does not have features to suggest NPH as the cause, such as urinary incontinence or magnetic gait.  I suspect that her recent deterioration was due to adverse reaction to psychoactive medication that has now been discontinued of limited.


We will make no change in medication today.  We will request the recent MRI from Mid Coast.  She will return in several weeks after we have gotten the MRI.

IDENTIFICATION:  A 71-year-old woman who presents to follow up diabetes.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  I received the patient's recent blood work and asked her to come in for a short-term followup.  Her hemoglobin A1c is 11.1.  We discussed her current system for managing her blood sugar.  She notes 100% compliance in using her NPH insulin, 45 units in the morning, 40 in the evening.  She is taking 2 shots of Humalog, on average, in the morning and just before bedtime.  She is doing 2 fingersticks a day, in the morning fasting and before bed.  She notes recent indiscretions in terms of her calorie intake.  She checked her fingerstick this morning, but cannot remember the result.  She is fully compliant with her other medications.  She was on simvastatin in the past, which was stopped because of liver test elevations.  She was on Crestor in the past, which was stopped at the time of a hospitalization when her CK was noted to be elevated.  Today, she is having no fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, dysuria, leg swelling, or leg numbness.

AMITRIPTYLINE HCL - urinary retention
GABAPENTIN - memory loss


Vital Signs
BP 126/68 L Arm, P 69, Temp 98.0, Wt 235.0 lb




PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is in no distress.  Her initial blood pressure, as she walked down the hall, was 154/71.  Repeating this after sitting was 126/68.  Lungs:  Clear.  Cardiac:  Regular.  Extremities:  Trace edema.



ASSESSMENT:  Uncontrolled adult onset diabetes.  Care for this will be challenging due to the patient's cognitive problems.  She does use Valley Hospital Web Services.  We discussed to start frequent communication via Web Services of test results will be helpful for me in helping her adjust insulin.  We discussed the possibility of changing from NPH to Lantus insulin, but elected to continue her NPH for now.  We discussed that her use of the ultra-fast acting insulin does not quite make sense.  She is taking an injection in the evening, long after her meal.  I asked her to describe her meals and she has carbohydrates essentially with every meal.  I think initially she can easily tolerate 10 units of Humalog with each meal.  She notes that she prefers to inject the insulin after she eats, which is acceptable as long she does it within a few minutes of the meal.  She currently is using an average of 15 units, so this will increase her total daily insulin use by just 15 units.  I asked her to check 3 fingersticks a day for me and to e-mail them on a daily basis to start.  She will check a fasting fingerstick.  She will check a fingerstick before her evening meal, which is her largest meal of the day.  She will check a fingerstick 2 hours after her evening meal.  She does not need to check a fingerstick right before bed.  She will stop using Humalog right before bed and only use the NPH at that time.  We discussed the importance of cholesterol treatment.  Her last LDL was over 100.  I would like to revisit the idea of using a statin.  I will repeat her CK level to see if this remains elevated.  Her blood pressure on recheck is acceptable.  I will see her back in the office in 2 months rather than what is booked now.  Most of our visit today took place together with her husband.  We spent a total of 25 minutes with more than half the time spent in counseling.

Date of Transfer: Jul 28, 2091

Pulm:  Geoffrey Lucas

PCP:  Evelyn Conway (Raymond)

Cards:  Janssen



ID/CC: SOB



HPI:   Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ a PMH notable for COPD w/ FEV1/FVC=63%, HOCM s/p MVR and septal myomectomy in 2085 who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past 4 days.  Of note, her and her son note increasing DOE for the past 4 months and she was scheduled for outpatient TTE today.  She also reports DOE and productive cough with green- yellow sputum that has been blood tinged ever since her EGD on 7/10/91.  She also notes recent URI symptoms especially runny nose as well as diarrhea the day PTA with 6 loose BMs.  On the day prior to admission, she had drenching sweats but didn't take her temperature.  She has also had decreased po intake (though improved w/ treatment for her trigeminal neuralgia) but denies F/C/CP/abd pain/dysuria.  Her symptoms acutely worsened today such that she was in acute respiratory distress and EMS was called..	

	EMS was called and the patient was noted to initially be speaking in full sentences but became more acutely SOB in the ambulance.  In the ED, she was afebrile but tachycardic to 120 and hypertensive at 180/80.  She initially required bipap with O2 sats of 93%.  She was given prednisone, Levaquin and nebulizers with mild improvement in her symptoms.  Of note, she was also noted to have mild ST changes on her EKG while she was tachycardic to the 120s.  She received ASA, Lopressor and Ativan and cardiac enzymes showed an elevated CK and CK-MB but negative troponin at 0.03.  Her EKG improved with rate control w/ IV Lopressor.  She was also given 30mg IV Lasix given some mild LE edema to which she put out 200cc urine.  She is now admitted to the floor for further management of her SOB.



ROS:   No F/C, + NS.  Improving appetite. No CP/Palpitations/Orthopnea/PND/Claudication, + LE edema for the past 1-2 months.  No N/V/D/hematochezia/melena. No delta MS/LOC. No slurring of speech, unilateral weakness. No dysuria.



Hospital Course: Patient had TTE performed on 7/24/91 which showed increase trans-mitral valve gradient. Given patient's history of MVR, TEE was recommended. On the night of 7/24/91, patient (who was known to sundown) tried to attack her roommate and fell on the floor hitting her head. No change in MS. In the setting of being on coumadin, patient had a stat CT of the head done which was negative for bleeds. On 7/25/91, patient went down for a TEE but desated to 80s and the procedure was aborted. Dr. Janssen then decided to perform cardiac cath on the patient Saturday 7/28/91. On 7/26/91, decision was made to put her on BIPAP for the night, and the patient did well and felt rested the next morning. On 7/27/91, because patient looked so well, she was not put on BIPAP but rather only on O2NC for the night. This AM, patient's respiratory status declined satting in the low 90s while on O2 6LNC. ABG was performed which showed 7.48/52/50. After speaking to cardiology, decision was made to transfer the patient to the CCU for intubation prior to cardiac cath this PM. A TEE will be performed while patient is intubated. Patient is currently NPO ready for cath this PM.



PMH:

1.	COPD- PFTs on 7/17/91 w/ FEV1=32%, FEV1/FVC=63%

2.	MVR- St. Jude's valve, 2085

TTE: Compared to the report of 09/09/2090, the transmitral gradients have increased, the degree of MR and AI has increased, and the RV systolic pressure has increased significantly. LV size and function remain normal. If clinically indicated, a transesophageal echo is suggested to better evaluate the prosthetic valve.

	CHANGES.



___________________________________________

Impression:

Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman w/ multiple medical problems including HOCM, s/p MVR and myomectomy as well as COPD who presents with increasing SOB and DOE for the past four days.  Of note, the patient notes increasing DOE for the past 4 months but with acute decompensation today.  Her progressive DOE may be related to CHF, especially in the setting of ischemic changes seen on EKG however, her acute decompensation may be related to COPD exacerbation in the setting of a viral illness.



Plan: 

SOB- Unclear etiology currently by may likely be multifactorial

--Treat COPD w/ Atrovent nebs, prednisone, O2, Levaquin

--Patient did not tolerate tachycardiac so Albuterol was DC'ed

--Follow urine output secondary to IV Lasix

--Daily weights, strict Is and Os

--Keep O2 sats 88-90% 

EKG changes- Pt w/o known history of CAD however w/ and ST depressions on EKG that appear rate related

--IV Lopressor to decrease rate

--ASA

--Cardiac monitor

--Cardiac cath per Dr. Janssen with TEE

MVR- On Coumadin

--Follow INR

Trigeminal neuralgia- Improving w/ pain control and Tegretol

--Continue current management

FEN- 

--Encourage Pos

--Replete lytes as needed

6.    Prophylaxis- Nexium, Coumadin

HPI: Ms. Mitchell is a 75 yo woman with CHF, HOCM s/p MVR X 2, COPD and multiple other medical problems who was admitted following brief episode of syncope.  Per pt and her son, for the past few wks pt has been feeling tired, with some minimal weight gain and ankle swelling.  Approximately 7-10 days prior to admission, pt given azithromycin for increased cough and COPD.  In addition, 8 days prior to admission, pt's regular lasix dose was increased from 80 to 120 mg for four days, then reduced back to 80 mg.  On the night prior to admission, pt was in the kitchen, leaning on the counter top, feeling hot and tired when as she was turning to walk back to bed, she began to fall back.  Her son, who was in the room, was able to catch her before she actually fell.  He reports that she seemed awake but was not responding.  There was no sz like activity, no bowel or urinary incontinence.  Pt was out for approx 30-45 seconds when she came to.  She does not remember going down.  She denies any auras before going down, no chest pain, no palpitations, no increased SOB.  No recent fevers, abdom pain or diarrhea.  Her son called EMT and she was brought in to PHH.

EKG: ? sinus, abnormal P-waves morphology 



Impr/Plan:  75 yo woman with MVR, HOCM, severe AS who p/w following episode of syncope.



1. Syncope: hx worrisome for cardiac etiology given suddenness of the episode w/o much warning.  Likely etiologies could be some decreased pre-load in setting of recent increased diuresis, perhaps decreased po intake in a woman dependent on preload 2/2 her valvular disease.   In addion, pt could have had an arrythmia which would necessitate interrogating her pacer.  Seizure activity is not part of the hx but the pt does have carotid disease which might have been playing a role as well.

--will check echo in a.m. to assess valvular disease, LV function, could consider stress test

--will consult EP to assess pacer function

--pt has already ruled out for MI but will keep her on monitor at least overnight

--will need to pay close attention to volume status as pt is very preload dependent 

--will re-check carotid studies

--will re-start ASA (it was recently stopped) given carotid and vascular disease



2. CHF: pt carries diagnosis of CHF and CXR c/w some pulmonary congestion.  On exam, pt with crackles bilaterally also c/w pulm edema.

--will cont outpt lasix but need to be very careful given pt's tenous volume status



3. COPD: cont outpt regimen



4. FEN: normal diet, replete lytes as needed



5. proph: boots, TEDS since pt HIT positive, nexium

Reason for visit:

   77 year old woman with mitral stenosis, S/P redoMVR for thrombosed St. Jude valve, now with porcine MVR, AS, COPD, S/P R total hip replacement.



Interval History:

   Mrs. Mitchell has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypertension and COPD.  She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.  She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.

			

Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range. 



Since her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.



She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.

INTERPRETATION:



FEV1 and FEV1/FVC are reduced, FVC is normal. TLC is normal. FRC is normal.

RV is increased.  RV/TLC ratio is increased. Resistance is increased;

specific conductance is decreased. Single breath diffusion capacity is

severely reduced, although there was only one adequate maneuver performed and

thus reproducibility cannot be assured. DL/VA is reduced. These data

demonstrate a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit. The spirometry obtained

today are similar to those from 12/14/2092. Resting room air oxygen

saturation is below normal limits, and there is significant arterial oxygen

desaturation with exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 58-year-old white male comes to the office for followup regarding his recent chest pain.


Chest pain.  The patient was in his usual state of compensated health, but approximately one month ago after clearing significance note from his driveway, the patient started to note some anterior chest discomfort.  He has a long history of coronary artery disease and this includes angioplasty and coronary artery bypass grafting in 2065.  The pain did not radiate up to his neck or arm, but when the pain persisted even after returning from Blountstown, he went to Roper Hospital North two days ago because of his chest discomfort to see his cardiologist.  He was admitted to the hospital, had a cardiac catheterization, which according to the patient did not show any specific lesion.  The doctors felt that he did not have a myocardial infarction, but that in fact his abnormality was due to a chest wall/muscular type syndrome.  He was discharged on anti-inflammatory medicine and the patient had noted that when he took the aspirin over the past month, his discomfort was improved.  The patient states that he had the chest x-rays at the hospital and in fact also had a CT scan, which did not show any pulmonary embolism.  It also did not show any dissecting aneurysm according to the patient.


Left renal lesion.  As part of his routine workup, the patient did have a CT scan and this identified some left kidney mass possibly on this scan.  The patient denies specifically any flank pain or any bleeding and he has no recent weight loss.  I spoke to the patient at length about this matter and he will consult with Dr. Jung, the urologist at Roper Hospital North.


Diabetes mellitus type 2.  The patient remains on his usual medicines and according to him, his hemoglobin A1c and blood sugars have remained fairly satisfactory.


Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient does not use his mask and I cautioned him to get back using that, as this may have an effect on his coronary artery disease.


Abnormal liver function tests, has been present for many years and previously was thought to be due to a fatty liver.


Elevated blood pressure.  The patient was noted in the hospital to have elevated blood pressures despite his medicine and he was asked to increase his Norvasc from 5 mg to 10 mg per day.


Gastroesophageal reflux.  The patient feels well on Zantac.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no specific headaches.  He denies any trouble with his ears, nose or throat.  He has no chronic cough or coughing blood.  He denies any nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stool.  He has no burning on urination.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Revealed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.  His blood pressure was 130/90, pulse was 60 and weight 207 pounds.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.  The neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.  The chest did show a healed coronary artery bypass graft scar, but he did have chest wall discomfort to palpation in the costochondral area on the left.  The lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.  Abdomen is soft.  No liver or spleen was felt.  Extremities showed no cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Neurologically, the patient was alert.


The patient was also sent to the office for evaluation because of his kidney function and the use of the scan during the CT scanning and use of the diet.


The patient was therefore ordered to have routine laboratory test including complete blood count, CBC, chem profile, lipid profile, urinalysis and I did a hemoglobin A1c because of his history of diabetes.


1.  Chest pain, probably due to chest wall rather than coronary artery disease according to the patient's history.
2.  New discovery of left renal mass to consult with Urology, Dr. Jung.
3.  Renal function to be rechecked secondary to his CT scanning and history of diabetes with Glucophage, which he has restarted.
4.  Status post coronary artery bypass graft.
5.  Abnormal LFTs by history.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Obstructive sleep apnea.


Will follow up with the patient by phone tomorrow regarding his lab tests and also he will consult with Dr. Jung and has a followup appointment with me for comprehensive exam in one to two months.

Diabetes.  The patient is trying to adhere to his diet.  He stays on his usual medicines, which include Glucophage and glyburide.  He takes an aspirin regularly and he is on his blood pressure medicines.  He does not smoke.  He follows closely his foot regimen and had not noticed any difficulty.  He sees a foot doctor.  He has not seen an eye doctor recently.  He has not been to the Jay Hospital for his routine followup and says he will start setting up appointments with the diabetes group out in Littleton, Wisconsin where he lives.  The patient specifically denies any increased thirst or urination.  His blood sugars taken at home are approximately 140-160 on a fasting basis.  He has not had any episodes of hypoglycemia.


Coronary artery disease.  The patient is also followed by Dr. Garza.  He does stay on his Plavix and aspirin and also is on other medicines including atenolol, hydrochlorothiazide, Norvasc, Vasotec and he has not needed any nitroglycerin.  He still does complain of some nonspecific chest type discomfort for which he was evaluated by Dr. Garza last spring.  He had a cardiac catheterization.


Elevated cholesterol.  The patient does take the Lipitor.  He does not have any muscle aches.


Slightly elevated liver function tests.  He had a history of fatty liver.


Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient refuses to take CPAP.


REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Reveals no headaches, no difficulty with the ears, nose or throat.  No neck pain, no chronic cough or sputum production and no chest pains or palpitations.  No nausea, vomiting, black or bloody stools.  No burning on urination.  His weight has been fairly stable.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Showed a pleasant white male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure taken by me 132/76, pulse 72 and weight 206 pounds.  Skin was moist and warm without any specific lesions.  Head, ears, eyes, nose and throat were normal.  Neck showed no thyroid nodes or tenderness.  No bruits were heard.  Lungs were clear to percussion and auscultation.  Heart showed a regular sinus rhythm.  S1, S2 were normal.  Abdomen was soft, no liver or spleen was felt.  Chest wall without any pain secondary to his prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  Extremities showed pulses to be satisfactory.  His feet were warm.  There was no sign of infection.  Neurologic, well oriented.  Light touch was found easily in his feet.


IMPRESSION:  Overall, the patient is satisfied with his health.  He has followup appointment with the cardiologist and needs to follow up with the eye doctor as well.  He will set up a diabetes follow up at the Rappahannock Medical Clinic.


DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Diabetes mellitus, on oral hypoglycemic medicines, will recheck his hemoglobin A1c, recheck his urine and urine for protein.


The patient does take his enalapril regularly as well.


2.Coronary artery disease on multiple medicines without any severe angina.  He is followed by Dr. Garza.  His weight has been fairly stable.  He has not needed to use his nitroglycerin.


3.Obstructive sleep apnea.  The patient refuses to take the therapy.


Elevated cholesterol, on Lipitor.


Essential hypertension on medicine.


Left kidney mass.  Dr. Jefferson did not feel this was any real finding.


Follow up will be in four to six months in my office for a comprehensive exam.


Routine laboratory test including CBC, hemoglobin A1c, comprehensive metabolic profile, lipid panel, urinalysis, TSH, urine microalbumin and PSA were ordered today.

The patient is a 71-year-old woman who comes in for follow up. She has been having
symptoms of ataxia which are difficult to understand in the sense that I cannot get a
clear history of her symptoms. At times she reports that she feels dizzy as if she might
fall over to her right side. There is no associated vertigo, dysarthria or other
symptoms. She has not actually had syncope. There is no positional component to her
symptoms. I had scheduled her for an MRA/MRI to evaluate those symptoms. The
MRI does show some small microvascular changes in the coronal radiata, centrum
ovale and bilateral pontine region. She had small chronic lacunar infarcts. She reports
that she falls to the right, but the stroke seemed to be more on the right brain which
would not necessarily correlate with her symptoms. She had some left internal carotid
mild 30% proximal stenosis. Her vertebral arteries were patent with anti-grade flow.  

PHYSICAL EXAM:  Small lacunar infarcts. Most likely related to hypertension rather
than embolic disease. Her blood pressure has been very well controlled. In fact, today
on exam, her blood pressure was 100/60. She brought her medications with her and
has been taking atenolol 50 mg p.o. q.d., Cozaar 50 mg 1 tab twice a day and
hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg p.o. q.d. She had not taken her medications today and
her blood pressure here when I repeated it was 110/70 in the right arm and 120/70 in
the left. Her neck is supple without JVD or bruits. Her lungs are clear without
wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Her cardiac exam shows a regular rate and rhythm, normal
S1, S2. 
       
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:   History of hypertension. Now with lower blood
pressure and some lightheadedness. We will d/c her atenolol. I would like her to get a
repeat blood pressure in one week. I discussed her MRI/MRA findings with her.
Long term we will need to continue to try and optimize her cholesterol levels and her
diabetes. She will follow up in one week for a repeat blood pressure.

NAME:     Wilson, Gabriel

MRN:     8514931



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Gabriel Wilson is a 72-year-old Croatian

female, referred by Dr. Fraser for evaluation of complaints of dizziness. Her daughter,

who is a Library Manager here, accompanies her mother today. Apparently, for

many years, perhaps as many as five, her mother has complained of ""feeling pulled""

when she walks. This never occurs when lying down or sitting. It is only when she is

walking that she feels she is being pulled, either to the right, left, forward or

backward. At times, she does visibly veer when she walks. She has had one fall a

number of months ago when she broke her wrist. She has not had any subsequent

falls. There is no associated true spinning vertigo, no associated visual change,

numbness, weakness, change in gait, change in speech and no headache. She actually

feels that over the past few weeks, it has been a little better, though prior to that, it

was a little more severe. Unable to associate this with any clear intervention.

Unaware of any precipitating or alleviating symptoms. 



Review of other systems notable for general fatigue. Otherwise unremarkable. No

chest pain, shortness of breath or abdominal pain. 



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hepatitis B, diabetes, hypertension, GE reflux,

hyperlipidemia, depression, cataracts. 



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Colace, Cozaar, Flonase, Fosamax, hydrochlorothiazide,

Lopid, meclizine p.r.n., Protonix, Prozac, Vioxx. 



FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for neurologic disease. 



SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is widowed and lives with her niece. She neither drinks nor

smokes. 



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: On exam, she is a pleasant, quiet, soft-spoken,

72-year-old female. BP 140/84. Cranial nerves II through XII intact to detailed exam,

except for decreased hearing on the left. On motor exam, no rigidity, no drift. Good

power throughout upper and lower extremities. She does, however, seem mildly

bradykinetic diffusely. Finger tapping was slow bilaterally and symmetric. Amplitude

is normal for finger tapping. Power in the lower extremities 5/5. Sensory exam with

mild vibratory loss in the toes. Finger-to-nose testing intact. Foot-tapping decreased

bilaterally. Romberg sway. Her gait is slightly wide-based, with occasional veering to

either side. She is unable to perform tandem. DTR's 2+ throughout, except for 1+

ankle jerks. Babinski flexor bilaterally. 



DATA: MRI/MRA of the brain 8/30 shows mild to moderate white matter

hyperintensity in the corona radiata, centrum semiovale and moderate bilateral

pontine involvement and multifocal lacunar infarcts of the lentiform nuclei, right

internal capsule and bilateral thalami. Intracranial atherosclerosis is seen involving the

anterior middle cerebral arteries with a greater degree of involvement of the

posterior cerebral arteries and intermittent development of moderate mid-segment

stenosis of the basilar artery. Bloodwork 2/27: SMA7 normal, except glucose 134. 8/30

bili, total protein, albumin, globulin within normal limits. LFT's normal except SGOT

elevated at 46. 



IMPRESSION: 72-year-old female with diabetes, chronic hepatitis C and

hypertension, complaining of basically veering of her gait and feeling unsteady. She is

symptomatic only when she walks. Her exam is notable for mild vibratory loss in the

toes, likely due to diabetic neuropathy, bilateral lower-extremity dysmetria and the

wide-based, at times veering gait. It appears that her gait difficulties with veering  are

multifactorial, due to history of multiple lacunar infarcts and peripheral neuropathy.

It does not appear that these episodes are due to transient ischemic attacks, given

that she veered in the office while walking and stated that this was the symptom she

is concerned about.  However, given her mid-segment basilar stenosis seen on MRI,

she certainly could become symptomatic from this down the road, particularly if she

became hypotensive. As she was unable to tolerate Aggrenox, will try adding

Persantine at a lower dose at 25 mg b.i.d., along with an aspirin per day, to see if she

can tolerate gradually increased doses of Persantine. I will see her in follow up in two

months to see how she is doing. May also consider checking CBC, given her

symptoms of fatigue and other bloodwork should these symptoms persist.

MRN:     8514931



The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia and multiple other medical problems. She has a history of TIAs and

was seeing the neurologist today for follow up. She has not had recent TIA symptoms

but related a history of exertional chest pain and was sent up here for evaluation.

Griggs was translating and the patient reports that over the past two months she

has been getting chest pain and pressure with some shortness of breath after she

walks about one block. The symptom is a pressure symptom which radiates to both

sides of her chest. It is not severe, sharp chest pain. It does not radiate to her back.

There is no associated rest pain or nocturnal pain. No PND, orthopnea or edema.

The last time she had the pain was two weeks ago. She has a history of TIAs and our

goal was to keep her blood pressure in the 140-160 range since they may be due to a

low flow state due to her vertebrobasilar disease.



She is on aspirin and Plavix.



She had a negative sestamibi ETT in 2087 except she had a very low work capacity.

She has not had a recent stress test.  



PHYSICAL EXAM: She is a very pleasant woman in no acute distress. Her blood

pressure is 160/70. Neck supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs clear without wheezes,

rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2, no diastolic murmur

or gallop. Abdomen soft, nontender without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema.  



Her EKG shows normal sinus rhythm. 



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Patient with multiple cardiac risk factors and a story

which sounds convincing for exertional angina. She has not had any symptoms in over

two weeks. Will add low-dose Lopressor 12.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. She should stop it if she

feels lightheaded on the medication. She should increase the aspirin to 325 q.d. We

will schedule her for a sestamibi ETT. She will follow-up in one week.

Visit Note



Patient Name: WILSON, GABRIEL                        MRN: 8514931

Dictated Date: 06/29/2097                      Dictated By: Julie Fraser, M.D.



Date of Visit: 06/28/2097





 Patient is a 76-year-old Croatian woman who came in today. Her daughter Gibbs was translating. She is a very complicated 76-year-old Croatian woman with a history of diabetes, hypertension, vertebral basilar insufficiency, chronic hepatitis B and other medical problems. She is status post a right Bell's palsy in the past. 



Recently she has been sometimes living at her daughter's house and other times at her niece's house. They are trying to provide more support in terms of regulating that she takes her medication. When she stays at her daughter's Gibbs's house her daughter does check her sugars though her niece does not. Her blood pressure has been very labile recently and we recently added hydrochlorothiazide and nifedipine extended release 30 mg every day to her regimen in addition to her regular Cozaar and Toprol. Her daughter also has increased her insulin/70/30 to 48 units in the morning. She thinks that sometimes in the afternoon or late afternoon she may have some low sugars. She reports that her mother feels dizzy and has difficulty moving her left leg if her sugar gets low. She feels better if she is given orange juice or something to eat. She has had similar symptoms to that with low sugars in the past however when the daughter checks her sugars they are all in the 174 to 225 range. She has occasional sugars before bedtime that are 337 and 249. The lowest sugar she had was 88 before dinner. 



The patient reports that she feels dizzy at times. She is a very difficult historian even with her daughter translating or with the other interpreters translating. She has not been having any chest pain or palpitations. Her dizziness is not related to standing up or lying down. No syncope, slurred speech, spinning dizziness, diplopia, or focal arm or leg weakness or numbness. 



Of note the chest pain she had complained about on the last visit when her daughter had noted she was cleaning has resolved. 



Her cardiac stress test from June 2094 showed an exercise capacity of 4 METS, EKG nondiagnostic due to submaximal heart rate response. No evidence for ischemia on the perfusion images. From March 2095 her vascular lab studies showed normal distal vertebral arteries and basilar arteries throughout its length. She also had carotid studies March 2095 that showed minimal disease of the right and left carotid. Her prior MRI from 07/95 showed chronic lacunar infarcts but no acute hemorrhage or infarct. 



The patient has had chronic slow speech and there is question about whether or not she has dementia. Her daughter is giving her the Aricept though it is not clear if this is benefiting her or not. Sometimes her daughter thinks that she is actually just being stubborn or uncooperative rather than having difficulties with her memory though other times it seems as if she she does have some dementia. 



She also has been followed in Glancy Memorial Hospital. 



On exam she is in no acute distress. Blood pressure 124/60. Neck: Supple without JVD or bruits. Lungs: Clear without wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular, normal S1, S2 without S3, S4, or murmurs. Abdomen: Soft, nontender. No CCE. She has chronic right facial weakness consistent with her known Bell's palsy. Cranial nerves 2 through 12 otherwise intact though vision was not assessed. Motor 5/5. Reflexes 1+, absent ankle jerks, downgoing toes. Gait is slightly wide based which is consistent with the prior note from Dr. Hope Kincaid. Sensation intact to light touch. Distal pulses intact. 



1. Hypertension which is much better controlled on current regimen. Continue same. Check Chem-7. 



Type 2 diabetes. Her daughter attributes some of her lightheadedness to hypoglycemia but the documented sugars are not at all low. Ideally we would correlate her symptoms with a fingerstick sugar. 



Lightheadedness and dizziness. We are going to check a Chem-7 and then repeat an MRI/MRA of her head and neck. 



She should follow up in neurology and also with her counselor. She will follow up with me in a few weeks after the MRI/MRA.

  Dawson, Quinten
  MR#:  4692758
  July 28, 2112
  
  Return visit.
  
  Reason for visit:  A 71-year-old male for comprehensive eval/management of multiple
  issues.
  
  Problems:  
       1.   Diabetes:  Continues on oral agents since 2087.  A1C is below 7.0 at goal. No
       hypoglycemia.  Fasting sugars less than 130 on balance.  Has regular follow up.
       2.   Hypertension:  Blood pressure well controlled on valsartan.  Cardiac ultrasound
       2111 with normal ejection fraction, no LVH and normal mitral regurg.  Continue
       current program.
       3.   Coronary artery disease:  Patient had mildly abnormal stress test with moderate
       posterior ischemia in 2112. This was done due to exertional shortness of breath.
       Those symptoms have essentially resolved. He has never used nitroglycerin.  He
       has gone through the cardiac rehab program. Now put on beta blocker due to
       patient's preference. No strong indication given. No MI or symptomatic angina.
       4.   Hyperlipidemia:  Tight control of lipids achieved on Zocor.  LDL less than 100.
       5.   Stroke: Status-post stroke 2111 with slurred speech and left facial droop.
       Warfarin recommended for one year at that time for presumed cardiac embolus. 
       Considered discontinuing this visit.  
       6.   Anemia: Patient has had a mild hyperproliferative anemia.  Has been seen by Dr.
       Barr.  This has remained stable.  Bone marrow biopsy nondiagnostic.
       7.   Hypogonadism:  Patient has been evaluated by Dr. Dominique Stokes.  Placed on
       AndroGel 2111.  Testosterone levels have improved.  Question if that has
       improved his fatigue and anemia.
  
  Review of systems:  He does have sleep apnea on CPAP.  Has bilateral hearing loss on
  audiogram. Has some peripheral edema on occasion.  Have recommended support
  stockings.  Urinalysis today showed greater than 100 red blood cells and he said this was
  due to penile trauma from tight shorts.  We will repeat this.  He did see blood that day. 
  He has never seen it since.  He has multiple seborrheic keratoses including on his penis. 
  He will see Field Crest Care Center.  Otherwise ROS is negative.  
  
  Family history:  Mother died of cancer in her 80's of unknown primary.  Father died of
  stroke in his 80's.  
  
  Physical exam:  Weight was 197.  Baseline 190.  Max 210.  Goal 185.  Blood pressure
  was 140/78.  Pulse 60.  Skin:  normal.  HEENT:  pupils equal and reactive to light. 
  EOMs full. Fundi normal. Mouth clear.  Neck: JVP6.  Carotids 2+ without bruit.  Thyroid
  normal.  Nodes:  none.  Chest:  clear lungs.  Cardiac:  S1 and S2 normal.  Grade II/VI

  Return visit.  Reason for visit: 73 year old male for evaluation/management multiple
  issues.  
  
  Diabetes: he is on maximal dose of glipizide and Glucophage and A1C has been going up
  steadily now to 8.0.  His sugars vary greatly in the morning from 100 to 174.  He hasn't
  been checking pre dinner.  We discussed insulin and he really is quite against it.  We will
  continue discussion open.  Asked him to check pre dinner sugars.  
  
  Coronary disease: patient had a mild posterior ischemia in 2112 on a screening stress test. 
  He is actually having some progressive dyspnea on exertion and a sense of chest
  tightness with one block.  He is a bit of a denier.  He hasn't tried nitroglycerin, which I
  have given him.  I suggested he do that.  He will have a follow up stress test and we will
  arrange a cardiology consult.  
  
  UTI: patient had an E coli UTI 9/13.  He doesn't really have much in terms of other
  prostate symptoms and no nocturia.  He has however, developed urinary urgency again in
  the last week or two.  Will check another culture.  May need urology referral.  
  
  Knee pain: patient with longstanding DJD of the knees.  Will have a consult at Christiana Hospital considering replacement.  
  
  Family history: unchanged.   
  
  Review of systems: status post an embolic stroke in 2111 and took warfarin for 2 years
  and followed by Dr. Dillon.  He is still on Celexa for depression.  He is having hearing
  loss with equivocal audiograms.  Suggested otology consult at Naples Community Hospital.  He has
  a mild hypoproliferative anemia that is stable.  Sleep apnea.  All other systems negative. 
  
  Physical exam: his weight is 196 pounds.  Most recent 195.  BP was 140/70.  Pulse 60. 
  Skin normal.  Nodes: none.  Chest clear lungs.  Cardiac: S1, S2 normal.  Grade II/VI
  systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation (confirmed by echo).  Abdomen no mass or
  organomegaly.  Extremities: mild venous stasis.  Trace edema.  DP pulses are 1+.
  
  Assessment: management of multiple medical problems as above.  Lab work up to date.  
  
  Disposition: every 4 months.  Comprehensive 5/14.

Problem List:  Diabetes.  Hypertension.  Hyperlipidemia.  Sleep apnea. 2/1/11 stroke 4/4/12 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Small posterolateral scar and ischemia  2/21/14 exercise sestamibi-SAH: Moderate-severe anterior apical and inferior ischemia.



Medications: Glucophage 850 mg t.i.d., glipizide 10 mg b.i.d., Cozaar 50 mg, Zocor 20 mg, Detrol 2 mg, Colace, aspirin 81, isosorbide 40 mg q.a.m., multivitamin, glucosamine and chondroitin b.i.d., Naprosyn 220-2 pills b.i.d., Celexa 20 mg. BiPAP



			

Reactions to Medicines: None



			

Chief Complaint: Shortness of breath which is, in fact, chest tightness



History of Present Illness: This 73 year-old hypertensive hyperlipidemic diabetic had a previous stroke on 2/1/11 and a recent exercise test that showed extensive ischemia as noted above.  He has noted shortness or breath for the last three months.  In fact the shortness of breath is exertional chest tightness which comes on with exertion and is relieved by rest.  He is sent by Dr. Everhart for consideration for coronary angiogram.  On 1/08/14 his cholesterol was 165, triglyceride 109, HDL 54 and LDL 89.  He does get some lightheadedness if he has a high sugar.  He's had no rapid heart action or sudden dizzy spells.



ROS:Const.-Negative

Eyes -Negative

ENMT: Bilateral hearing loss

CV: See above

Respiratory: Sleep apnea

GI -.  Recent constipation  

GU -Impotence.  Urgency and incontinence  

MS -  arthritis of both knees and hands.  Considering knee replacement

Skin - Negative

Neuro -CVA in past.  Mild residual left facial drooping and occasional trouble finding words.

Psych - Depression well controlled on Celexa

Endocrine -  Diabetes

Heme-No blood problems

Allergies - No drug allergies and no allergies to dye



Past History:  T & A, laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  He has no other major illnesses.  He does not smoke and drinks about one glass of wine per day.



Family History: His father died at 83 of a stroke, cancer and diabetes.  Mother died at 73 of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.  Two sisters are living without diabetes.



Social History:  He a mapping technologist and is actively working.  He is divorced and has two children and one grandchild.  His significant other works as an optician.  She is divorced and has three children and one grandchild.



Complete Cardiovascular Exam:. BP 100 50/65.  His jugular venous pressure is seven and he has no carotid bruits.  He has no rales.  He has a 1/6 aortic ejection murmur, a 2/6 MR murmur at the apex with a normal S2 and no S3.  He has no enlargement of the liver and no edema.



EKG:   NSR 59, LAE, NSTTWA



Assessment: I agree he clearly needs a coronary angiogram as well as a left ventricular angiogram to assess MR.  He should also have a left right heart catheter because of the aortic ejection murmur.  In the meantime I will ask into double his isosorbide to 40 mg in the morning and again at 3 p.m. to give him better protection throughout the day.  I will ask him to increase his aspirin to 325 mg a day.  I will also add fish oil 1000 mg a day which is been shown to reduce the risk of sudden death.  Finally we will double his Zocor to 40 mg to try to reach the new goal of an LDL of less than 70.  I explained the rationale for proceeding on with the catheterization and the probability that we will find multivessel disease that will not be suitable for PCI but rather for continued medicine or possible surgery.  Of course the catheterization will determine that.  He should not consider any total knee operation until the cardiac status is clarified.

RE:  Peter Joshi

     MR #453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of meeting Peter Joshi in the Cardiology Clinic on February 24th.  Mr. Joshi presents with a complaint

of dyspnea and oxygen requirement.  The patient does relate that

he has had breathing problems in the past and in fact, markedly

worse several years ago.  However, with the treatment of his

coronary artery disease, he had been doing somewhat better until

he underwent surgery for a carotid artery stenosis.  Since that

surgery several months ago, he has had a prolonged period of time

during which he has required supplemental oxygen.  At the same

time, the patient is being treated for congestive heart failure

and in fact, has had a recent increase in his dose of standing

Lasix.  The patient relates that during his hospitalization, he

did have what sounds like a pleural effusion, which a physician

did try to drain, however, unsuccessfully.  At the current time,

Mr. Joshi is feeling slowly better and feels as though he is

able to take a deep breath, which he was unable to do several

months ago.  In fact, he was told recently that he does not need

supplemental oxygen.  He denies a chronic cough, although he does

occasionally have some difficulty swallowing which leads to

coughing.

 

His past medical history includes diabetes, carotid artery

stenosis, coronary artery disease with both angioplasty and stent

placement, congestive heart failure, bladder cancer,

hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and

upper GI bleed.

 

 

RE:  Peter Joshi

     MR #453-39-84-4                -2-                 02/24/70

 

His medications include aspirin, Lasix, Isordil, Zestril,

Lopressor, simvastatin, Norvasc, Prevacid, a multi vitamin,

potassium, albuterol, Atrovent, Serevent, and insulin.

 

He has no known drug allergies.  He discontinued cigarette

smoking years ago.

 

On exam today, he had a blood pressure of 122/60.  His pulse was

56, afebrile.  O2 sat on room air initially was at 90%, but when

I rechecked it, it was 95%.  His weight was 221 lbs.  He is in no

respiratory distress at rest.  His oropharynx had dry mucosa and

a somewhat small posterior pharyngeal air space.  His neck had no

enlarged lymph nodes.  Chest had diminished breath sounds in the

left base with crackles.  His right lung was clear.  His heart

was in a regular bradycardic rhythm with a II/III systolic

murmur.  His abdomen was protuberant, but benign.  His

extremities are with 1+ pitting edema and no clubbing.  Pulmonary

function testing had been performed in December and was repeated

again today, which demonstrates that he has a combined

restrictive and obstructive ventilatory defect.  His current

vital capacity was improved approximately 10% from that of

December.  He has no bronchodilator response.  I took Mr. Joshi

for a short walk and he never desaturated below 92% and that

includes after walking up one flight of stairs.

 

In summary, I believe that Mr. Joshi has dyspnea which is likely

mostly related to congestive heart failure and deconditioning. 

However, I do believe he might have a pleural effusion based on

my exam and based on his history and therefore, I have referred

him to have a decubitus chest film taken.  Mr. Joshi had several

questions related to his metered dose inhaler use and I have

recommended that he use only Combivent 4x a day regularly.  I do

not believe there is any benefit to be gained from an inhaled

corticosteroid for this gentleman.  I do recommend that he get

daily exercise.  He certainly needs to continue his diuresis and

I will certainly check his chest x-ray on the outside chance that

he may benefit from            a pleural effusion.  I have also

confirmed to him that he no longer requires supplemental oxygen. 

His pulmonary function testing also had demonstrated a reduced

defusion capacity, however, it does correct when accounting for

albuterol volume and therefore do not believe that he is likely

to have either an interstitial lung disease or pulmonary

vascular disease.  However, we will certainly reassess this after

his initial work-up.  Thank you for referring this interesting

patient.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to

call.

 

 

 

Sincerely,

RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.  This lovely gentleman continues to see

both me and Dr. Orlena Knowles.  I have discussed this with Dr.

Knowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all

would need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care.  He notes that

his weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed

closely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium

chloride doses.  He has had no shortness of breath at rest.  He

has noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema. 

He has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  His

medical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO

b.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,

Lopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5

mg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d. in

addition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.

 

His physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right

and left arm seated.  After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right

and left arm seated.  His heart rate is 70 and regular. 

Respiratory rate is 10.  His room air saturation is 95%.  His

lungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are

somewhat distant.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for

nondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.  His

abdomen is soft and nontender.  Extremities are notable for edema

to his knees bilaterally.

 

RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4            -2-              June 06, 2070 

 

Electrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14

and normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.  No

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing

congestive heart failure.  His pulmonary evaluation here was

notable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive

pulmonary dysfunction.  I would certainly concur with continued

diuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and

creatinine.

 

If there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.

 

Sincerely,

Re:  Peter Joshi

MR #45339844

 

Dear Dr. Hodges:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic at the Hospital Regional Universitario.  This lovely gentleman with ischemic heart disease and 

congestive heart

failure has been followed in our clinic since the time of his carotid 

endarterectomy and cardiac

procedure.  At the present time, he notes that he has been very minimally 

active because of the

flooding.  He has had no paroxysms of chest discomfort.  He has had no exertional 

neck, chest, arm

or jaw pain.  He has had dyspnea on exertion at greater than 4 METS of 

activity and he does

have mild lower extremity edema.

 

His medical regimen includes aspirin, Demadex, isosorbide, Lopressor, 

simvastatin, Norvasc,

Prevacid, multivitamins, potassium chloride and insulin.  

 

On physical examination, his weight is 223 pounds.  His blood pressure is 

124/60 right and left

arm seated.  His heart rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  

There is a mild increase in

jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without bruits.  Lungs are actually 

clear to auscultation

throughout.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for a systolic ejection murmur 

but no gallop is

present.  His abdomen is soft, nontender, free of organomegaly and bruits.  

Extremities are

notable for symmetric pulses somewhat diminished at the level of the 

posterior tibialis and mild

pitting edema to the midshin bilaterally.  

 

His electrocardiogram is sinus bradycardia with inverted T waves in I and L.  

No significant

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Patrick Joshi looks like he is in mild volume overload at the 

present time.  He reports

that he has had renal insufficiency in the past.  Before adjusting his 

Demadex dosing, I will

reassess his kidney profile.

Dear Dr. Craft,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.  This lovely gentleman with coronary artery

disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction

notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,

who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.  Despite this

intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,

palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present

time.  He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg

p.o. t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,

simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid,

multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.

 

On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.  His heart

rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  There is no

increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without

bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. 

Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and

physiologically split S2.  His abdomen is soft and nontender.  He

has no bruits.  His extremities are warm with strong symmetric

pulses and motor strength throughout.  He has no peripheral edema

at the present time.  His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus

bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,

and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior

electrocardiograms.

 

Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a

concerning blood pressure.  At this point, he notes that he is

actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue

to do that.  We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will

be following up with you within the next few weeks.  If there are

any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me

a call.

 

Sincerely,

Re: Nancy Xayarath

ANC Unit #:  111-64-17



Dear Dr. Townsend:



	I had the pleasure of seeing Nancy Xayarath today with regards to callus formation over the plantar aspect of her left foot.



	As you are aware, she is a 57-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and Charcot arthropathy of her left foot that has resulted in a rocker bottom deformity.  She currently wears accommodative orthotics typical for somebody with her deformity.  She has noted that perhaps over the last two weeks or so that a callus has formed under the plantar lateral aspect of the left foot. She denies any drainage, erythema, or increased swelling or warmth in the foot.  Her orthotics were made in September and seem to be working quite well for her. She admits however that over the last month and half or so that she has been wearing boots that her current orthotics do not fit in. Apparently, she has had to resort to her old orthotics, which did not take her Charcot deformity into account.  



	Her past medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Her medications include Prograf, prednisone, Prilosec, an aspirin a day, Imdur, calcium supplement, a multi vitamin, Lantus insulin, and Humalog with meals.  She takes Imuran, Coumadin, and Toprol XL, as well as Lipitor.  Her past surgical history is significant for colostomy in 2094, fistula repair in 2095, coronary artery bypass surgery times four in 2096, a kidney transplant in 2097, and a fistula ligation in 2098.  She quit smoking ten years ago and has no known allergies to medications.

	

	Physical examination is centered mainly around her left foot.  She has diminished sensation to ten-point examination with a Semmes-Weinstein 5.05 monofilament.  She has multiple toe amputations, all of which have healed nicely. She does have a palpable dorsalis pedis pulse.  The skin is of normal turgor. She has no active plantar ulcers on

either foot. At the apex of her rocker bottom deformity on the left side there is a callus that I d  brided in the office underlying which is a grade 0 ulcer.  



	No new x-rays were obtained today.



	Diagnosis: Grade 0 ulcer, diabetic left foot.



	Plan:  She has not reached the dermis on her left foot, however, should she continue to weight-bear without mechanical off-loading it is only a matter of time before this develops into a grade I ulcer.  It is unclear to me whether the culprit is an orthotic that needs to be remolded or the fact that she has been wearing boots with an inappropriate orthotic.  I am going to have her see Samantha Albright, our orthotist to have the insoles remolded with Plastizote.  I have asked Ms. Xayarath to bring the shoes that she typically wears as well as the boots she wears.  We will follow this development closely as Ms. Xayarath is perfectly aware of the potential downsides of forming an ulcer. She knows to contact me if she has any questions or concerns in the meantime. Thank you kindly for this referral.



Best personal regards,

Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.



She had been losing weight and feeling fatigued. She has been at her current weight for several weeks and feels that she has stabilized. Appetite has been good. 



Home Blood Tests:  No records. She reports that she drops from the 200's to the normal range in the morning. Her bedtime test is about 3-4 hours after summer.  

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Xiques in the Spring. May need laser for p-cataract film. Retinas stable.

Nephropathy:	Cr 1.0 in September. Saw Dr. Caldwell re her Charcot foot. He put her in a boot and wheelchair for 3 weeks and it resolved well. 

Cardiac:	Gets little tingling sensations in her anterior chest, occurring at any times. Not specifically at times of physical exercise. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: Prograf reduced.



Review of Systems: 

GI: Feels that her abdomen is uncomfortable much of the time. Not precipitated or relieved by food. Upper and lower abdominal. No change in volume or nature of ileostomy output. She has dysphagia for liquids, sometimes with regurgitation. 

Had Pap and mammogram through ANC gynecologist.

She saw Dr. Wilhelm for sinus problems. He got an MRI. It showed a meningioma of the jugular foramen. Dr. Wilhelm's note indicated that she would see Dr. New for that and indeed she has seen Dr. New, although she says it is for a tumor on the vocal cord. 

He also wanted her to see Dr. Carter about a vocal cord paralysis, and that visit is upcoming. 





Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   118/70		P:   72, regular

Wt:   118.5 without shoes, down 8.5

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Dyskinetic prominent apical impulse. Normal S1; single S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. Small epigastric hernia with mild tenderness in that area. Ileostomy. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.       DP 2+,=.  PT absent. Prominent mound of tissue in the plantar aspect of L foot, from Charcot changes, but with very normal skin covering.  Good foot care.



Impressions and Plan:	

Many active issues.

Hard to assess control without data. Must bring them to visits.

For now, reduce the Lantus to 8 U since she drops overnight by history.

Will need to talk with Dr. Wilhelm and Dr. New about their respective perspectives and figure out who is addressing the meningioma and hydrocephalus. May need to see a neurologist. 

Refer to Dr. Sanders for evaluation of her gastrointestinal discomfort and dysphagia for liquids. I suspect a motility disorder.

She needs follow-up with Dr. Arndt. 

1 hour; most counseling and coordination of care.

A1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, CBC, anti-gliadin antibodies, anti-transglutaminase antibodies, TSH.

History of present illness

			

  Oneill was hospitalized at the Muscatine Health Center shortly after leaving the YCH following his catheterization and placement of the stent by Dr.  Hall.  Because of the recurrent chest pain at Muscatine Health he was catheterized again from the left groin and the stent seemed to be functioning normally.  He was given the usual supportive therapy and discharged.  He is now taking Isordil 30 mg SR daily as isosorbide mononitrate.  He takes metoprolol 25 mg one-half BID, Procardia XL 30 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg per day, K-Dur 20 mEq daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg daily, Advair 25/50 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg per day, terazosin 10 mg per day, and atorvastatin 10 mg HS.  He states that he feels completely well.  He has noted good healing in the left groin.  No new issues.

   Cardiologist:  Hall



Mr. Innis is a 77 y/o man with h/o CAD s/p LAD stenting (Taxus Express 3.0x16mm) in 3/95.  All other vessels had only minimal irregularities.  Since that time, he has had only mild chest discomfort which is always relieved with nitroglycerin.  



This morning, he had a more severe episode of chest pain accompanied by SOB and diaphoresis that started when walking to the dock after starting his boat.  The pain was primarily in his back, similar to his angina prior to stenting.  The pain lasted for approximately 30 min despite SL NTG, although did go away eventually.  He had diaphoresis, SOB, and blurred vision associated with the pain.  He was brought to the ED by his family.  On arrival, he was pain free. P 60 BP 110/70.  He was treated with ASA and Lopressor.  EKG was unremarkable.  Two sets of markers were negative.  He is admitted to complete rule out MI and further diagnostic testing.



He currently denies pain and feels back to his baseline.  He denies orthopnea, PND, LE swelling, + occasional palpitations, no syncope/near syncope.

	Interval History:
   Mr Innis is a 77 y.o male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and CAD. His cardiac history dates back to March 2095 when he experienced dyspnea and exertional chest pressure that radiated to his jaw and arms. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed LAD disease and he underwent PTCA/Taxus stent to his LAD. 

He did well until August 2096 when he presented with a dull mid scapular discomfort that radiated to his upper chest. These symptoms were accompanied by diaphoresis, dyspnea and transient blurry vision. After evaluation and clearance by Neurology he underwent another cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed his LAD stent was patent but he had a 90% lesion proximal to the stent. He had PTCA/Vision stent to his LAD. 

Since 11/19/2096 he has had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with relief of his dyspnea. He continues with daily exertional chest discomfort that resolves with rest and sl nitroglycerin. 

Today he presented for elective cardiac catheterization which show ed a proximal 90% occlusion and mild In stent restenosis. He had a cypher stent placed in his LAD. He arrived in Cardiology pain free and hemodynamically stable.

Reason for visit   Brucellosis

History of present illness   70y/o F who presented in late May with daily fever x 2-3 months with low back pain x 2 weeks, admitted May 30 and found to have small gram negative rod bacteremia consistent with Brucellosis, which fits with her epidemiologic exposure to unpasteurized camels milk and her prolonged fever. There was initial concern for TB, but she ruled out for pulmonary tb with 3 negative smears. PPD positive. 

She had an MRI of her spine that was initially read as L5/S1 diskitis/osteomyelitis with right paraspinal phlegmon . MSK radiologists felt that this actually represented degenerative change with no evidence of infection, with explanation that a large right-sided osteophyte is causing irritation. 

Mrs. Iles declined a TEE on during her admission. 

She was treated with streptomycin IM q daily x 2 weeks,and concurrent doxycycline 100 mg po bid plus rifampin 300 mg po tid. 

She was seen in ID clinic on 7/20, 9/7, 11/9, and today (1/4/81). She has improved dramatically, and is able to walk independently without pain. She has no fevers, night sweats, weight loss, nausea, or vomiting. Her pain is well controlled minimal medications.

Assessment and plan   70 yr F with confirmed Brucella bacteremia from May 30/31 2080 and probable Brucella diskitis/osteomyelitis at the L5/S1 level. She presented with a syndrome of constitutional symptoms and back pain of 3 months duration, and has improved dramatically after 2 weeks of streptomycin IM (completed), rifampin 300 mg po tid, and doxycycline 100 mg po bid. Her antibiotics started on 6/4/80 and will be discontinued today 1/4/81 after 6 months of therapy. 

She was counseled today that she is to watch out for recurrence of infection, which may include fever, night sweats, weight loss, anorexia, worsening back pain, and fatigue. She knows to contact us should this occur. 

She was counseled to not drink unpasteurized camel milk.

In addition, Mrs Iles is PPD positive: she has completed the required 4 months of therapy for latent TB (she had 6 months) as part of the treatment of her Brucella infection. 

All Allergies Reviewed
	

Ms. Iles was seen and examined with Dr. Tillman. Her back pain, fevers, and weight loss have entirely resolved. She has finished six months of doxy/rif and should stop these medications. We asked her to return for any new back pain, fevers, or weight loss.

                          OFFICE NOTE

 

Cora Quinley

MR# 759-87-55-2

March 3, 2077

 

As the responsible teaching attending, I can confirm both the

history and physical examination of Dr. Uriel Zapien. Briefly, the

patient is a 71-year-old female with several cardiovascular risk

factors. She was admitted to the hospital in January after a

prolonged episode of palpitations. The patient had a tiny

Troponin  elevation to 0.3, and the decision was made to manage

her conservatively. The patient continues to have these episodes

of palpitations, but she does not get chest pain with any

exercise.

 

Her current medical regimen includes aspirin, beta-blocker,

statin and an ACE Inhibitor. 

 

On physical examination she has 2+ carotids, which have normal

upstrokes and no bruits. Her lungs are clear to auscultation. Her

heart examination reveals a regular rate with a normal S1 and S2,

without S3 and S4.

 

Her electrocardiogram is normal.

 

Assessment: I concur with Dr. Zapien in that we will increase the

patient's beta-blockers to decrease her probable supraventricular

tachycardia. She will be seen back here in several months.

FOLLOW-UP VISIT: CAD, DM, HTN



HPI:  The pt is a 71 yo female here for follow-up visit for DM monitoring, lipid management, htn.  She was hospitalized for acute MI last December and is being followed by cardiology.  Since her last follow-up the patient has had no episodes of exertional or rest chest pain, no DOE or SOB.  She was visiting her relatives in Oregon this month and did have one episode of SVT in setting of viral URI.  Experienced sudden onset of palpitations with discomfort, lasted 30 minutes without chest pain, lightheadedness or diaphoresis and then resolved spontaneously.  She has had no further episodes.  She has been compliant with her medications over the last few months and has not experienced any side effects; however, when asked directly, has had 2 or 3 episodes of lightheadedness in morning with abrupt position changes, nothing long-lasting and no near syncope.

     Pt reports blood sugars by finger stick at home of 100-140s generally.  Has had good control by her accounts over last few months.  Was unaware of results of May blood draw with increase in HA1C of 8.0.



Medical problems:

SVT  

LGI BLEEDING  

SMOKING  

H. PYLORI  

NIDDM  

Coronary artery disease  

Myocardial infarction

abd: soft NT ND with normal BS

ext: normal pulses, no edema



Labs:  last hemoglobin A1C in 5/77 of 8.0, gluc 192, LDL 115, TG 71, HDL 36



A/P:  71 yo female with DM, HTN, and heart disease with slightly worsening glycemic and lipid control when tested 2 months ago, perhaps related to modest weight gain of 10 lbs.

     1. DM - pt with rising A1C despite good FS at home.  Given pt feels control has improved since last visit, will stall on changing micronase until next visit at one month.  Pt to have repeat a1c at that point, and if still high, will double micronase.  Good bp control on zestril.  Had microalb this year.  Still awaiting visit to ophthal - gave pt another referral.

     2. CAD - pt with LDL of 115 when previously well controlled on this dose of zocor.  After negotiation with patient, have agreed to wait to raise dose until next visit as well.  Would benefit from 30 mg tab.  Otherwise TG look good.  Pt with episode of SVT in setting of viral illness.  BP and pulse will tolerate small increment in b-blocker.  Given known CAD without intervention, impt to control SVTs.  Increase atenolol to 100 mg QD, keep zestril at current dose.

     3. HM - pt refuses mammogram.  She continues to be suspicious that screening tests are experimental and given her age ""wouldn't change anything.""  Discussed baseline bone density test, and she has agreed to consider this.  Refused colonscopy at this point.

Dear Dr. Feldman:

We had the pleasure of seeing your patient Cora Quinley in followup
today in the Cardiology clinic.  As you know, she is a
very pleasant 72-year-old woman with diabetes, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, active tobacco use, there is probable coronary
disease, with preserved left ventricular function (EF 60% on
echo), as well as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.  She
last saw me in clinic in 03/2077, and missed several followup
appointments in part because she spends much of her time in
Oregon.  Over the past year and several months, Ms. Quinley has
been doing quite well.  She states that she has episodes of
palpitations approximately every 2 months, lasting less then 5
minutes.  She notes a sensation of fluttering in her chest, with
no chest tightness, no dyspnea, no lightheadedness, no syncope. 
She denies PND, orthopnea, or angina.  Unfortunately, Ms. Quinley
continues to smoke, but is actively interested in quitting.  She
states that she is planning to enroll in the Stonybrook Smoking
Cessation Program.

Her current medications include enteric-coated Aspirin 325 mg
q.d., atenolol 100 mg q.d., lisinopril 20 mg q.d., Lipitor 20 mg
q.h.s., metformin 1000 mg b.i.d., Micronase, fluocinolone,
Protonix, and Allegra.

On examination, she is well appearing today in no distress. 
Blood pressure is 128/60 mmHg in the right arm, and pulse is 65
beats per minute.  Extremities are warm, with no peripheral
edema.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk bilaterally with no bruits. 
JVP is 8 cm of water.  Chest is clear to auscultation and
percussion bilaterally.  PMI is nondisplaced, with a normal S1,
physiologically split S2, soft S4, no murmurs, no rubs.  Abdomen
is soft with no masses or hepatomegaly.  Pulse examination is
normal.

Recent lipid profile from 03/2078 reveals a LDL of 150.

ECG today demonstrates normal sinus rhythm at 67 beats per
minute, PR interval 154, QRS duration 78, QT interval 442, QTC
467, and QRS axis 33 degrees.  There is a nonspecific Q-wave
abnormality, and prolonged QT, with no significant change
compared to prior.

In summary, Ms. Quinley is doing quite well.  Her palpitations and
likely SVT are occuring at a frequency that Ms. Quinley feels are
quite acceptable for her.  Therefore, she wishes no consideration
of possible interventions or changes in her medical regimen.  She
has no symptoms to suggest current coronary ischemia.  Regarding
her cardiovascular risk factors, her blood pressure is reasonably
well controlled today, and you are actively managing her
diabetes.  However, her lipid profile demonstrates an elevated
LDL.  Therefore, I have taken liberty of increasing her Lipitor
to 40 mg q.h.s.

I plan to see Ms. Quinley in followup in approximately 6 months. 
Please feel free to contact me otherwise regarding her
cardiovascular issues.  Thank you very much for referring this
very pleasant woman for cardiovascular care.  

Ms. Quinley was seen, examined, and discussed with our clinic
preceptor, Dr. Queen Frank-Newman.

Reason for Visit:  moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Stage IVB 





Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 

Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 



History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia about 4 weeks ago.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 



He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss and minimal symptoms when he chews his food well.

Data (laboratory and radiographs) 



see above



Assessment and Plan:



72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer. He is doing quite well. Given the fairly asymptomatic nature of his cancer we have opted to start with radiation first, as his primary mass is fungating in nature and there has been evidence of blood loss. After radiation is completed in 3-4 weeks, I will see him for consideration of chemotherapy but only after re-staging. If he remains asymptomatic and there has been little progression of disease, we may opt to observe him closely without treatment. If the scans show significant progression or he becomes symptomatic, then we will start systemic treatment soon afterwards. He is not a surgical candidate given his stage of disease and lack of symptoms.



RTC in 5 weeks to assess symptoms and to arrange restaging scans.

Mediquik Team 3 Medical Student Admission Note



Pt:  Vollmer, Ulyses	

MR#: 	8740465

Date of Admission: 03/17/84

Attending Oncologist: Dr. Xavier Otero

PCP:  Dr. Geno Guidry

Code Status: Full Code



ID/CC:  73-year-old man with stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents complaining of three days of constant dizziness.



Source:  Patient, who is a good historian.  Past medical records.



History of Present Illness  



Mr. Vollmer is a pleasant 73-year-old man with a past medical history significant for metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma s/p XRT and chemotherapy, CAD s/p LAD stent placement, and borderline DM who presents to the Health Care Center complaining of 48-hour history of dizziness and subjective fevers.  He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he awoke in the morning with a severe headache.  As he got out of bed, he felt extremely lightheaded.  He describes the dizziness as internal, and    not like the room was spinning.     He laid down, with some resolution of the symptoms.  Of note, he reports that the dizziness is less severe when he lies down and comes on with standing or sitting up.  Throughout the day, he developed a cough productive of green sputum, a subjective fever, continued headache, and nausea without vomiting.  He denied any chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or pain upon deep breathing.  That evening, two nights prior to admission, he developed night sweats but had no rigors.  He continued to feel similarly throughout the day prior to admission, and presented to the emergency room for further evaluation.  



The current presentation is in the context of increasingly poor PO intake secondary to chemotherapy and treatment for esophageal cancer.  He reports a four-to-five month history of poor appetite, eating chicken soup.  He denies any trouble swallowing solids or liquids.  Of note, the day prior to the onset of symptoms, he was NPO for a restaging CT scan.  He reports eating two scrambled eggs after the scan, and a chicken potpie for dinner the night prior to symptoms starting.



In the emergency room, vitals were temperature of 95.6, pulse 52, blood pressure 132/68, RR=20, 95% on room air.   He received Zofran 4 mg IV once, levofloxacin 500 mg PO once, and a NS 500 cc bolus.  CXR showed bibasilar infiltrate and bilateral pleural effusions.



Oncology History (per attending notes)

Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 3/14/84 Restaging work-up revealed progressive disease (see imaging below).



His last Taxotere treatment was February 17; further treatment was stopped secondary to a chemotherapy burn on the right arm.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



I/P: 



73-year-old man with metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma presents with bibasilar pneumonia and small bilateral pleural effusions.



1.	Pneumonia:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness, subjective fevers, and productive cough of green sputum. Physical exam reveals decreased bibasilar breath sounds, right greater than left.  The constellation of symptoms can be attributed to the pneumonia found on chest imaging.  The possible causes of the pneumonia include aspiration, infectious, and post-obstructive causes. The patient reports no problems with swallowing and has not vomited, making aspiration pneumonia lower on the differential.   The chest CT does not show any evidence of tumor obstruction around the bronchi.  Further, the pneumonia and pleural effusions are bilateral, meaning that the obstruction would have to be higher in the bronchial tree, making obstruction less likely.  In this case the most likely cause is infectious in nature; the agents most likely to cause pneumonia in this patient are the typical bacteria, such as pneumococcus, H. influenza, Staphalococcus, and other gram-negative bugs, atypical bacteria such as Legionella sp, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, and viral causes.  Based upon imaging findings, pneumonia most consistent with a bacterial infectious agent.

a.	Start Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for antibacterial coverage.

b.	Sputum gram stain and culture

c.	Blood cultures

d.	Pneumococcus antigen screening

e.	U/A, urine Legionella

f.	  NS at 75 cc/hour.  If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5  NS.

g.	Tylenol for fever, Zofran for nausea.

h.	Incentive spirometry every two hours while awake.

2.	Dizziness:  The patient presents with a two-day history of dizziness.  Potential causes include orthostatic causes secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or poor sympthathetic tone; anxiety; cardiac causes (dysrhythmias, CAD), anemia, and electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypoglycemia).  This patient has a history of CAD, but EKG findings and cardiac enzymes do not suggest cardiac insult.  The patient has not had an increase in the BUN or creatinine from baseline, making dehydration less likely.  Labs did not show any electrolyte abnormalities; therefore hypoglycemia is low on the differential diagnosis.  The dizziness was positional in nature.  The patient reports long-standing poor PO intake, particularly because he was NPO for much of the day prior to the start of symptoms. In this patient, the cause of the dizziness is most likely orthostatic in nature, secondary to poor PO intake and decreased sympathetic tone.  

a.	  NS at 75 cc/hour.  If PO intake is not increased, will switch fluids to D5  NS.

b.	Check orthostatics daily.

3.	Metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma:  Patient presents with known Stage IV-B metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma with new CT findings suggestive of disease progression, particularly in the retroperitoneum.  Has been on Taxotere for the last six months.

a.	Patient does not know of new findings, to discuss with Dr. Otero in AM.

b.	Consider alternative therapies.

4.	Anemia: Patient presents with microcytic anemia (MCV=73).  Not known to be iron-deficient.

a.	Iron studies (Iron, Ferritin, TIBC) to assess iron deficiency versus anemia of chronic disease.

b.	Guaiac stool for evidence of occult blood.

5.	HTN:  

a.	Check orthostatics daily.

b.	Patient is stable on current regimen.  No changes to medications.

6.	CAD/hypercholesterolemia:

a.	Continue with Lipitor 10 mg daily

b.	Cardiac enzymes negative times one.  Per Oncology fellow, no need to cycle given stability of TW changes in EKG and lack of anginal symptoms

c.	Low fat diet

7.	Renal vein thrombosis: 

a.	Stable on Coumadin.

b.	Clarify goal INR level.  Currently INR=3.4.

8.	Prophylaxis:

a.	Nexium for GI prophylaxis

b.	Colace/Mylanta for constipation.

c.	Low-fat, no added salt, no concentrated sugar diet.

d.	Finger sticks after each meal.

Nathan Altman, HCC III 

Pager #74972







Team 3 Intern Addendum:

The patient was seen and examined.  Agree with above excellent HCC3 note.  Briefly, the patient is a 73 year-old male with h/o esophageal CA (Stage 4B), DM, HTN, CAD s/p LAD stent, renal v. thrombosis on Coumadin.  He presents today with 2 days of malaise, nausea, and    dizziness,     which he states does not consist of ""room spinning"" but that he does feel off-balance and is associated with nausea.  His PO intake has been decreased due to nausea.  Has has had a cough productive of green sputum, and CXR evidence of bibasilar consolidations and decreased breath sounds on exam R > L.  He was admitted to medicine for treatment of PNA in the setting of multiple comorbidities, and for lightheadedness on standing which is likely orthostatic.  



Will treat with Levofloxacin 750 PO QD to cover CAP.  Send legionella urinary Agn, and sputum cx (blood cx sent in ED).  Check orthostatics.  IVF gentle hydration.  Need to clarify goal INR in setting of Coumadin use for renal vein thrombosis.  Microcytic anemia-will check anemia labs; already on iron supplementation.  EKG and 1 set of cardiac enzymes do not suggest an acute cardiac event.  Will treat nausea symptomatically.  Discussed with onc fellow (Dr. Kramer).

Patient Name: CURTIS, OM;  MRN: 7682941

Dictated at: 05/21/88 by VICTOR R. GOMES, M.D. 



Mr. Curtis returns with a history of ureteral stones, BPH, and dysuria.  He has not had any stone passage in the last six months.  He has passed some tissue, and had some gross hematuria with his last visit, but has not had any symptoms since then. 

  

With his BPH, he has not had any significant worsening of his nocturia or daytime frequency.  He feels as if he is emptying his bladder well now on the Cardura.  He did have some dysuria, and Dr. Geiger gave him a pill which seems to have helped him.  

 

His review of systems today is negative.  His past medical history is unchanged, and he is continuing with a cholesterol medication, a pill for burning, Cardura, and Atenolol. 

  

On physical examination, his vital signs show him to be well-nourished and well-developed.  His respirations are 14.  His pulse is regular.  A general examination shows his neck to be supple.  He is alert and oriented x 3.  He has no labored breathing.  He has no palpable groin adenopathy.  His skin has normal turgor, and his cardiovascular exam shows no JVD.

   

A complete GU examination shows his epididymis to be without masses.  A rectal exam shows his anus to be without masses.  His scrotum is without lesions.  His urethral meatus has no discharge.  His prostate has some BPH, but no nodularity.  His penis has no foreskin lesions.  His testes have no masses.  His seminal vesicles have no masses.  His sphincter tone is normal. 

  

An independent review of a urinalysis today is negative.  A review of clinical lab testes shows a nuclear matrix protein less than 10 on 11/14/87.  This was done via PCIS.  A post-void residual today is 14 cc.  

 

For his BPH, I believe he should continue with Cardura 2 mg p.o.  q.d.  His stone disease is quiescent, and he will let me know if there are any recurrences with symptoms of these.  We will consider checking a KUB in one year's time.  He will let me know if there are any difficulties in the interim.

He is feeling quite fine today.  He has no specific problems to being to my

attention.  He says that he is having no problems with chest pains whatsoever and

that includes with exertion.  His breathing has been fine as well.  No shortness of

breath.  Otherwise he denies any abdominal pains, joint pains, bowel or bladder

difficulties.  The remainder of the review of systems is negative in detail.  



PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, he looks well.  Skin is clear.  HEENT - PERRLA. 

EOMI.  TMs and throat clear.  Neck supple.  No thyromegaly.  No

lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm.  No

murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  No masses.  No HSM. 

Extremities with no edema.  Neurologically fully intact.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Angina/hypertension/hyperlipidemia.  He is doing quite well and very stable. 

     Since his cholesterol was in such great shape just a few months ago, no need

     to recheck here today. 



(2)  Bladder stone.  He had this dealt with by Dr. Gomes of Urology.



(3)  Diabetes mellitus.  Very stable.  Check glycosylated hemoglobin.  He is up to

     date on his eye exams.  Follow-up with me in three months.

squamous cell cancer.  He is following closely with the radiation oncologist and the
medical oncologist.  He is seeing them both later this month.  He has had no
problems with chest pains or shortness of breath.  All in all, things are going well.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  On exam, no acute distress.  Lungs are clear.  Heart is regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  He does have some skin
discoloration around the left axilla but I feel no mass.  He has a well-healed incision. 
There is no hair noted in or around the axilla.  Extremities with no edema.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  

(1)  CAD/hypertension/diabetes mellitus.  This is stable.  Check glycosylated
     hemoglobin. 

(2)  Metastatic squamous cell cancer.  He is being followed closely by Oncology for
     this.  Follow-up with me in the spring.

Chief Complaint	

Admission note- Internal Medicine

Kenneth Weeks- 1205466





History of Present Illness	

Mr. Weeks is a 78 yr. old male who was admitted for further cardiac testing.



His PMH includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation.  He has been experiencing increasing dyspnea with exertion over the past 5 weeks.  He has especially noted this when he climbs stairs or walking up an incline.  He also notes this SOB when he is walking the golf course. He denies any chest pain or orthopnea, although he states that he has been experiencing some ""indigestion"" the past few days.  It usually occurs in the morning. He was given sublingual nitroglycerin and notes improvement in his symptoms  His Lasix dose was increased on 4/3/96 (from 80 mg to 120 mg).  This increase did help his symptoms a little, but he still felt his exercise capacity had decreased.  



An ECHO was done on 4/10 which was not significantly changed from 1/95.  His EF was 74%, mild MR, dilated LA, symmetric LV hypertrophy without any obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities and RVSP 43 mmHg.  



A Sestamibi stress test was done on 5/19.  The patient exercised for 3 minutes 21 seconds reaching 84% of predicted HR.  His EKG had STD AVF, V4-V6.  The perfusion scans showed a moderate, reversible mid-distal anterior, septal and apical defect indicative of moderate ischemia.  LV function preserved.



He was admitted electively today for further evaluation. He arrives to Internal Medicine chest pain free and hemodynamically stable.

Plan:



1. Cardiac:  Currently pain free and hemodynamically stable

         -- Admit to Internal Medicine/telemetry

         -- NPO after MN for cardiac cath in the am

         -- Will begin ECASA

         -- Continue Atenolol- pt. recently changed from Cardiazem to Atenolol given ETT results.  HR well controlled at present.

         -- Continue Norvasc and Avapro- SBP currently well controlled. 

         -- Pt euvolemic on exam- will continue Lasix - holding tomorrow pre-cath. Follow strict I/O's and daily weights- will adjust Lasix dose as needed depending on fluid status and renal function. 

         -- Pt in AF- last Coumadin dose on Friday- will begin Heparin pre cath.  Will need to resume coumadin once all interventions completed.



2. Renal: Pre cath creatinine 2.1.  Pt had renal angiogram in 4/95 which showed patent renal arteries.

         -- Will give Mucomyst and NaHCO3 protocol pre cath.    

         -- Monitor urine output.  

         -- Follow renal function closely post dye load

         -- Will hold ARB and diuretic pre- cath- will reassess post cath.



3. DM: Long hx of DM- per pt. well controlled on present regimine

Will continue NPH and Glipizide- holding in am of cath.  Will check fingersticks QID and cover with RISS.  Diabetic diet. Pt. also reports poor dietary compliance- will obtain nutrition consult.



4. Thrombocytopenia: Pt with long history of low platelets- per pt. he has never had this worked up.  Will follow closely. ? need for hematology consult at some point- will discuss with Dr. Felder.  Watch CBC closely while on Heparin.

Victor Medical Clinic

55 Harbor Avenue, BUL-773

Pullman, MN 74618



Dear Thomas:



  Thank you very much for referring Mr.  Weeks for evaluation of coronary disease, mitral insufficiency, atrial fibrillation, and congestive heart failure.  As you know, he is a 78-year-old gentleman who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting on 07/20/2096 and had two-vessel CABG at that time with a LIMA to mid LAD and a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.  Left atrial appendage was amputated and he had a closure of a PFO as well as a CryoMAZE procedure.  The patient had symptoms of dyspnea on exertion prior to coronary artery bypass grafting.  After the coronary artery bypass grafting, he had done well but now is noting that the shortness of breath and dyspnea on exertion has recurred.  It has been progressive over the last several months.  He had been seen by GI and also by Pulmonary and has been treated for gastroesophageal reflux.  He was found to have a pleural effusion which has been drained and he has had sclerosing of that.  He has also had an admission for renal failure this spring.



Past medical history:

   Notable for insulin-dependent diabetes.  

Hypertension.  

Hypercholesterolemia.  

Hyperhomocysteinemia.  

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  

Benign prostatic hypertrophy.  

Gout.  

Renal insufficiency.  

Mild thrombocytopenia.



Current Medications:

  atenolol 25 mg BID

 Coumadin; Dir: as directed

 Ecotrin 325 mg qd

 Lipitor 20 mg qd

 Lasix 120 mg qd

 folate 1 mg qd

 allopurinol 100 mg qd

 Ativan

 Proscar

 free text medications; Dir: Insulin

 Protonix



Allergies:

No known drug allergy   or IV contrast dye.



Family history:

   Positive for brother who is status post stent placement at the age of 78 and another brother with congestive heart failure.  There is also peripheral vascular disease and diabetes in his family.



Social history:

   The patient has a 25-pack-year history of smoking, quit in 2065.  He does not drink alcohol.  He lives independently with his wife and comes to the interview with his daughter who works at Casco Bay Shipping.



Review of systems:

   Negative for fevers, chills, weight loss or gain.  He has not had any visual loss or hearing loss.  He denies hematochezia.  He has not had difficulty swallowing, change in bowel habits, constipation, diarrhea, or hematemesis.  He denies chest pain, PND, orthopnea, or pedal edema.  He denies dysuria or hematuria.  He has not had any rashes or poor healing wound lesions.



Physical examination:

-Pulse:   55 and regular

-BP: 160/80    in the right and left arm in seated position

-resp. rate:   12 and unlabored

-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline

-Neck:   Thyroid is not palpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  Have a normal upstroke.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water

-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  He does have low dullness in both bases

-Cardiac:   Remarkable for well-healed midline incision of the sternum.  He has a normal S1 and S2 and a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur radiating to the apex and a grade 1/6 high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border which is different from the other murmur

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly.  No pulsatile masses

-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 2+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis



Procedures:

Tc MIBI STATUS POST The patient underwent adenosine MIBI testing on.  His heart rate from 67 to 90 which was only 62% of the maximal predicted heart rate.  Peak blood pressure was 158/80.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear imaging showed distal anterior wall and apical septal defect consistent with mild-to-moderate ischemia in that distribution.  The patient has also had an event monitor but we do not have the results of that in hand.



EKG:

    today shows atrial fibrillation with a fairly regular rate at about 55, leftward axis, and IVCD with nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.



Selected recent labs:

 Laboratory results recently have shown plasma creatinine of 2.4, BUN of 42, hematocrit of 30.4, white count of 5.4, and platelet count of 92,000 all done on 12/22/2096 and 12/26/2096.



Assessment and plan:

   In summary, this is a 78-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, closure of PFO, and ligation of the left atrial appendage and Maze procedure which was done in July 2096. His anginal equivalent prior to that was dyspnea on exertion and he did well for a period of time but now has dyspnea on exertion again. There are a number of factors involved here. He has atrial fibrillation which is now recurrent but the rate seems to be reasonably well controlled. I doubt that, that is playing a role in his shortness of breath. He also has a history of plural effusions which could have been contributing to shortness of breath as well and that has been dealt with corrosion of the pleura. He has mitral regurgitation which in the past was said to be moderate and he has had the closure of PFO. He has insulin-dependent diabetes and hypertension. He also has low platelets. The recurrence of the exertional dyspnea is certainly worrisome for recurrence of coronary disease particularly with the exercise test showing anterior wall ischemia. It may be that there are other issues contributing to this, the atrial fibrillation and mitral regurgitation. He has murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation, but he has no evidence of decompensated congestive failure at this time. Blood pressure is elevated somewhat and I think that increase in his Avapro might be worthwhile. He also has chronic renal insufficiency which makes things more complicated as well. My feeling is that we are dealing with recurrence of coronary disease and I spoke with the patient about this. He is clearly limited in his exercise capacity and wants to have something done. I would like to get an echocardiogram to be sure we are dealing with constrictive disease, but I think he will probably need to have a cardiac catheterization. I would like to get the echocardiogram, bring him in for cardiac catheterization, and see if there are narrowings either in the graft or in his native arteries that may be contributing to the anterior wall ischemia. Starting him on an antiarrhythmic to see if we can reestablish sinus rhythm may be worth considering or perhaps cardioversion after the cardiac catheterization. Because of renal insufficiency, cardiac catheterization is a little bit more complicated and that the low platelets are also an issue we need to address.

(908) 649-3317



CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Follow-up laboratory testing.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old white

man who I have not seen since November of 2088.  Approximately

four weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.  He saw colored

spots floating in his visual field.  He has been noting some

decreased depth perception and visual acuity.  At the same time,

he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he

believes were migraines.  He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.

 He was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation. 

Dr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits. 

However, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which

came back at 10.2.  Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I

had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly

elevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose.  He

never returned for that testing.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,

obesity, and gout.



MEDICATIONS:  HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d.,  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney

failure.  This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto.  He is

currently on a leave of absence from work.  He is a nonsmoker.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He believes that he has lost some weight over

the past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount.  He has been

noting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and

nocturia.  Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,

respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and

dermatologic are negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a pleasant obese white

man in no acute distress.  Vitals: Blood pressure 134/90, pulse

66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI,

anicteric sclerae.  Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes. 

Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Chest: 

CTA&P bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no MRG.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,

NT/ND, NABS, no HSM.  Extremities:  No CCE.  Neuro:  A&O x 3, 2+

DTRs bilaterally.



LABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per

minute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.   Diabetes.  The patient was advised that his laboratory

testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset

diabetes.  Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to

start him on metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.  Use and side effects

were reviewed.  He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and

fasting lipid profile checked today.  Unfortunately, he was not

actually fasting.  He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and

Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education. 

He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.  He is asked

to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.  He

was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens

swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.  I assume that this

will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.  He

was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job

until his symptoms clear.

2.  Migraines.  The patient does sound as if he is also having

migraines.  We will address this at future visits.

RE: Michael Ogrady

       MR #631-90-33-7

 

Dear Dr. Patton:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Michael Ogrady in consultation for 

his coronary artery

disease, before his surgery for esophageal cancer.  As you know, this is a 

63-year-old male with a

long past medical history which includes diabetes, coronary artery disease, 

peripheral vascular

disease, hypertension, smoking history, hypercholesterolemia, DVT and newly 

diagnosed

esophageal carcinoma.  He has been followed by his cardiologist, Yehuda 

Landers, for the last nine

years.  Essentially he has every cardiac risk factor and known coronary 

artery disease which is

documented on cardiac catheterization performed on 1/20/93.  The 

catheterization demonstrated

right dominant system with 100% RCA lesion, a complex 30% diagonal 1 lesion 

and a 30%

marginal 1 lesion.  There was collateral flow noted from the LAD to the right 

PDA and from the

septal 2 branch to the RCA, and from the circumflex artery to the RCA.  The 

procedure was

performed through the right radial artery without complications.  Patient 

also has peripheral

vascular disease and is status post a left femoral posterior tibial saphenous 

vein bypass graft in

2088.  He is also status post atherectomy and dilatation of stenosis in the 

femoral to posterior

tibial graft.  He also had a left leg DVT in 2090.  His activity level is 

limited by his claudication. 

He has a history of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and diabetes on 

treatment.  

 

At baseline he has dyspnea on exertion after walking half a mile.  He gets 

chest pressure one to

two times a month.  However, his activity is extremely limited.  He reports 

that he has had a

positive stress test.  Further information is not available.  Patient 

understands he has coronary

disease, however does not have amenable disease for angioplasty.  On 

catheterization he had

preserved ejection fraction of 62%.  

 

He is to undergo esophageal cancer surgery in the next one to two months 

after receiving

chemotherapy and radiation therapy preop.  Patient states he will be 

receiving a Hickman

catheter and a jejunostomy tube placement before his chemo and radiation 

therapy. 

 

On physical exam, the patient is obese, weighing 288 pounds.  His blood 

pressure is 100/72,

heart rate is 57 bpm.  HEENT: oropharynx benign.  Neck: carotids intact 

bilaterally without

audible bruits.  Lungs: distant breath sounds.  Cor: without obvious jugular 

venous distention. 

Heart sounds distant.  Normal S1 and S2.  No appreciable murmurs.  Abdomen: 

unable to palpate

firm masses or aortic aneurysm.  Bowel sounds present.  Extremities: status 

post surgery to the

left flank with 1 to 2+ edema to the knee.  Distal pulses are absent.  Neuro: 

intact.

 

EKG: Sinus brady with first degree AV block.  IMI with age undetermined.  

Nonspecific STT

wave abnormalities present.  No previous EKG for comparison.

 

Impression: 63-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male with known coronary 

artery disease and

peripheral vascular disease who has preserved left ventricular function.  He 

clearly has ischemia

on a positive stress test.  I would recommend dobutamine echocardiogram to 

check ischemic

threshold.  He is clearly at intermediate risk for a perioperative cardiac 

event.  However, given

his life-threatening esophageal carcinoma, patient wants to proceed with 

surgery even

understanding possible complications.

 

Plan:

1.   Dobutamine echocardiogram to check ischemic threshold.

2.   Recommend intravenous beta-blockers during the surgery with fairly tight 

control of

     blood pressure and heart rate, utilizing the information determined on 

dobutamine

     echocardiography.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your patient, Michael 

Ogrady.  Please do

not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

 

Sincerely yours, 

 

 

Susan Ximena Elias, M.D., M.M.S.C.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. Ogrady is a 66-year-old gentleman who is coming in to Grafton Clinic to establish care and to discuss several medical issues.

1.  Pain.  He has whole body pain, mostly in his abdomen and his leg, and this has been longstanding for 2 years' time.  Has been treating with Percocet initially at about 3-4 per day but most recently, as high as 6 per day and in fact, 6 per day is the average.  He was seen in the pain clinic and was started on Neurontin.  It is unclear how compliant he has been with that regimen.  Dr. Hoover has been renewing his Percocet prescriptions.  He has had a CAT scan done in the past because of a history of esophageal cancer, which showed no evidence of cancer or no other etiology for his pain.

2.  Esophageal cancer status post resection by Dr. Patton.  He has been doing okay from that standpoint, is followed up with Dr. Yan.  The last CT scan was in June 2095 that showed some pulmonary nodules and a renal cyst that needed followup.  He has not yet had a repeat CT scan that was scheduled for yesterday, and he did not go to the appointment because he wants to do it at the Cancer Center where he feels more relaxed.

3.  Coronary artery disease.  He is status post an MI in 2084.  He has had several angiograms but no angioplasties by his report.  He is followed by Dr. Mckee at the Trimont Health Care Center.

4.  Status post fem-pop bypass of the left side.  He says he has been having increasing pain over the last several years on that side, which is why he takes the Percocet.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for coronary artery disease and diabetes mellitus with unclear control.  His last hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and that was in 10/94.  Status post cholecystectomy, status post appendectomy, esophageal cancer status post resection, and history of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.



MEDICATIONS:  Diovan 80 mg p.o. b.i.d., metformin 1000 mg p.o. b.i.d. diltiazem 240 mg p.o. q.d., Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d., Prilosec 20 mg p.o. b.i.d.  Percocet 5/325 six times per day, Dyazide 37.5/25 one time p.o. q.d., isosorbide 60 mg p.o. q.d., and Lopressor 125 mg  p.o. q.d.  



SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives with his wife.  He is retired.  He used to smoke, quit in 2084.  Smoked for 20 years 2 packs per day.  No alcohol, no drugs.  



FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother died of cancer, unclear what type.  Father died of an MI and had diabetes mellitus.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Comprehensive review of systems was done and reveals that that he has chronic abdominal pain that is unchanged, occasional chest pain, and chest palpitations that has been evaluated by his cardiologist.  No fevers or chills.  No burning or pain with urination.  The rest of the review of systems was negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, his blood pressure is 122/80 and his pulse is 80.  His height is 6 feet and his weight is 230 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  He is well appearing.  Sclerae are anicteric.  Conjunctivae noninjected.  Pupils equal, round, and react to light.  His extraocular are movements intact.  Oropharynx is without erythema or exudate.  Oral mucosa is moist.  Neck has no significant lymphadenopathy.  JVP is flat.  His thyroid is within normal bilaterally.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Good aeration, good air movement, no accessory muscle use.  Cardiac exam is regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, S2.  He has a systolic murmur, which has been reported previously.  His abdominal exam is soft, nontender, nondistended.  He has a large central hernia.  He has several surgical scars.  His extremities, he has no edema, his DP pulses are 1+ bilaterally.  His reflexes are trace in the knees, toes are downgoing.  His skin exam, he has multiple nevi, some that are rather dark.  No specifically suspicious lesion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  A 66-year-old gentleman with multiple medical issues.

1.  Diabetes, recheck hemoglobin A1c today.  He is going to find out when the last time it was he had an eye exam.

2.  Pain.  He has had this pain syndrome for quite some time.  He is on short-acting narcotic and I think this is appropriate.  I am going to start him on a fentanyl patch 25 mcg p.o. q.d. and decrease his Percocet to 4 per day.  Hopefully, we will be able to wean him off his Percocet altogether.

3.  Esophageal cancer.  Follow up with Dr. Yan and Dr. Patton.

4.  Pulmonary nodule.  I emphasized the need for him to repeat his CT scan.  I sent an email to Dr. Yan.  He wants to only do them at the Cancer Center and that is where last films were done.  I explained how important it was.

4.  Idiopathic thrombocytopenia.  We are going to watch this.  He had a workup by Dr. Sawyer in the past.  He reports no bleeding.

5.  Coronary artery disease.  I asked him to get Dr. Landers's records for me, especially his last angiogram.  We are going to check his cholesterol today.  He will follow up with me in approximately 1 month's time to reevaluate his pain.

6.  His EKG today shows a sinus rhythm at the rate of 60, normal intervals, normal axis, and poor R-wave progression in the precordial leads and as indicated above, possible septal infarct and possible inferior infarct.  I do not have a baseline for comparison.4. 5.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pressure.

Mr. Ogrady is seen by the resident and also seen and examined by

me.  He is a transfer from an outside hospital to be admitted

because of his chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 67-year-old man who was

loading some luggage in a car this morning at about 4:30 a.m.  At

that time, he experienced acute onset of squeezing, chest pain,

and chest pressure associated with shortness of breath.  He

described his pain as being very intense about 9/10, described

heaviness across his chest and shortness of breath.  He stated

that while he was walking into his place his chest pain got worse

and since then it was intermittent and stuttering in nature.  He

was taken to Muncy Valley Hospital where he was seen, treated,

and transferred here.  He is currently pain free.  At Oakridge State his troponin was negative.  His CPK was

negative.  His EKG showed a Q-wave in III and aVF and had no

acute ST elevation or ST depression on his cardiogram which

correlates with our cardiogram here.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  His history, however, is significant in

that he has a cardiac catheterization that was done in 06/2093. 

At that time, he had proximal LAD lesion of 30%, left main was

30%, and left circumflex was also 30%.  He had an RCA lesion

which was 100%, RCA proximal lesion, with good collateral flow. 

His last echocardiogram was in 03/2093.  At that time, his LV

function was normal and he had an EF of 55% to 60%.  His past

medical history is significant for diabetes and hypertension as

well as high cholesterol, had an myocardial infarction in 2084,

history of metastatic esophageal cancer and history of DVT in his

left lower extremity in 2090.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  He has had an esophagectomy.  He

underwent fem-pop bypass surgery in 2088.  He has also had a

cholecystectomy and appendectomy.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a 40-pack-year smoker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Also, has a strong family history of cardiac

disease.

MEDICATIONS:  He is now pain free but described his pain this

morning as squeezing, pressure like, and heaviness in his chest.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His vital signs here are normal.  His

HEENT exam is benign.  His neck is supple with clear lungs

bilaterally.  He has a 3/6 systolic murmur.  He has no rubs or

gallops.  His pulses are normal, well perfused throughout and

warm extremities.  Abdomen is soft without any masses, good bowel

sounds.  Extremities are normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG as described above again, a Q in III and

aVF, otherwise no acute changes on his cardiogram.  His CK is 33

and his troponin is negative.  His creatinine is 1.9 with a BUN

of 27.  All other labs are normal including his blood sugar which

is 156.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's cardiologist is Dr.

rule out and maybe even need another cardiac catheterization if

necessary.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain and chest pressure with history of an MI

and history of coronary artery disease.

EDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^03/16/98^OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS

I saw this patient with resident Dr. Elijah Parker.  Please see

his note for further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed

and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation

on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male

with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery

disease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,

status post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.  He was

discharged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.  He

had been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed

with a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was also given 1 g of

ceftriaxone.  His complaints prior to presentation had been chest

pain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and

palpitations.  On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem

and Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.  Other systems

were reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,

hemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.  Please see the chart.  He is currently

on aspirin and took today.

ALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic

appearing, and nontoxic.  Temperature 98, pulse of 111,

respirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations

are 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.  HEENT exam:  Mucosal

membranes are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. 

Lungs:  Crackles at the right lung.  Left lung is clear.  CVS: 

Tachycardic but regular.  Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse

tenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no

Murphy's.  He has normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and

dry.  Back is nontender at CVA points.  He has got bilateral

lower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and

calves.  Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented

without focal motor or sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2

bands.  Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated

with creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of

1.2 when he was discharged.  LFTs are all normal including lipase

and total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly

elevated.  First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.  EKG shows a

sinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave

changes.  Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have

been there in the past.  There is a hazy opacity in the right mid

hemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could

represent tumor versus pneumonia.  However, no significant change

prior to his discharge.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated

white count, this case was discussed with Oncology.  He was

admitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.  He is in stable

condition.

Patient was admitted to the observation unit at JCH overnight because of his complaints of chest pain.  Plan had been to cycle enzymes and provocative testing, however, this am patient adamantly refused to stay in hospital and understanding leaving included incomplete evaluation of chest pain and risk of death, patient signed out AMA.



I left the obseration unit to walk downstairs and find patient signing into the ER ""I want to go to detox""

Asked patient why he left OU to just come back to the hospital and he said ""There is nothing wrong with my heart"".



Patient also reports he thought he had a place to stay but after making a few phone calls, realized he had nowhere to go to spend the night.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN
54 y/o Spanish speaking male with HTN, HL presents to PNC after syncopal episode 2 days ago and was found to have AS at OSH.  Mean gradient of 38mmHg indicates moderate disease.  Prognosis after syncopal episode due to AS is 3 years.

AS:  Monitor for syncope, CHF, ischemia
Repeat Echo to assess valve area, gradients
Afterload reduction--start on ACE
Cont statin, check lipid panel
Avoid nitrates, diuretics
His symptomatic AS warrants w/u for AVR
Ischemia: EKG changes c/w LVH although doesn   t quite LVH meet criteria. Did have + enzymes at OSH, although denies hx of chest pain. Positive biomarkers ? due to coronary insufficiency in the setting of AS.
Cont ASA, lipitor

HPI: 
Patient is a 54 y.o. male with h/o aortic valve replacement, CHF, and HTN who presented to PNC as a transfer from Montebello Convalescent Hospital with a diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to Montebello Convalescent with a history of RUQ pain that began on July 3rd. He was found to have choledochal stones and underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy on July 07. Subsequent to this he developed a bout of generalized abdominal pain two days later and he was noted to have a marked and new increase in his amylase and lipase levels (3191 and 2171, respectively), diagnosed as acute post ERCP pancreatitis and transferred to PNC for further management.
Dr Gregory Xing explained to him via an interpreter and with images of his CT scan that he has gallstones and pancreatic pseudocysts that have persisted as compared to his last CT in July 2117.
The procedure of open cholecystectomy with Roux en Y drainage of pancreatic psudocyst was explained to him and he was consented. 


He will be an inpatient 3 days prior to surgery for transition from Coumadin to heparin / lovenox therapy.
He is presently doing well, with no fevers or abd pain. He is eating well and has returned to his normal life.

	CARDIOLOGY
	

	PARK NICOLLET CLINIC
	


	Reason for visit:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis presenting for follow-up. 


	Interval History:
   The patient's complicated cardiac history dates back to 3/17 when he underwent mechanical AVR for symptomatic severe AS.  He had preserved LV function and pre-operative cardiac catheterization showed multi vessel non-obstructive CAD.  He initially did well, but had a prolonged hospitalization in 7/17.  At that time, he developed acute cholecystitis and post-ERCP pancreatitis which was complicated by phlegmon and pseudocyst formation.  He was admitted to PNC in 1/18 for elective open cholecystectomy and roux-en-Y cyst-jejunostomy.  He underwent the GI surgery on 1/11/18.  His post-operative course was complicated by recurrent GIB upon re-initiation of anti-coagulation for the mechanical AVR that prolonged his hospital stay. 

Unfortunately, he developed line-associated bactermeia and sepsis 4 weeks into the hospitalization.  He developed high fevers on 2/07/18 ad he had serial cultures positive for MRSA that had intermediate sensitivity to Vancomycin.  He was initially treated with Vancomycin and Gentamicin with addition of Rifampin later in the course of treatment.  He developed progressive PR prolongation on ECG and  a TTE on 2/10/18 and TEE on 2/11/18 showed vegetations on the aortic prosthesis with evidence of annular involvement with abscess.  A follow-up TEE on 2/17/18 showed worsening aortic root abscess and he was ultimately taken to the OR by Dr. Elrod on 2/17/18.  The intraoperative findings were notable were notable for severe aortic root involvement and he underwent composite aortic homograft replacement that was complicated by severe RV failure.  On POD 0, he had recurrent malignant arrhythmias (VT/VF) which required ~ 50 defibrillations and open cardiac massage.  A TEE done after stabilization showed global akinesis and severe TR, and preserved LV function.  Emergent coronary angiogram showed evidence of RCA vasospasm.  An IABP was placed and he was treated with beta blockade and for vasospasm.  HE was taken to the OR for closure on 2/22/18.

His course was subsequently notable for ARF which transiently required CVVH, development of HIT, and vascular emboli to the right lower extremity which led to dry gangrene og the right 3rd digit. ABI testing revealed no evidence of PAD.  He was followed by ID and was placed on daptomycin and Bactrim. He was seen by Vascular surgery and was not deemed to require any surgical intervention and was scheduled for outpatient follow up.  With supportive care, he was successfully weaned off IABP and ventilatory support and transferred to the step down unit.  His course there was notable for mild hyperkalemia that was felt to be related to Bactrim induced RTA. He also had severe depression that was felt to be related an adjustment disorder. He was discharged to a rehab facility on 3/22/18 and was discharged from rehab 12 dyas ago.

Since discharge, he reports doing relatively well. He reports fatigue and DOE after walking up a flight of stairs.  He is able to walk up to 15-20 minutes continuously.  He denies any chest pain, dyspnea at rest, PND, orthopnea, LE edema, palpitations, syncope, or pre-syncope. He also denies any fevers, chills, or weight loss. He has been seen in follow up by Dr. Infant-Nickel in ID earlier this month.  He was noted to be doing relatively well but still had an elevated ESR and CRP.  The plan is continue a prolonged oral taper of Bactrim.  He has completed a 6 week course of daptomycin.


	Past medical history:
   1. MRSA/VISA prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis. Originally underwent AVR for severe AS on 03/13/2117. Developed aortic endocarditis and aortic root abscess as a complication of line sepsis in 2/18 and underwent composite aortic homograft replacement on 2/19/18. Intraoperatively developed severe RV failure.
2. RV failure. Complication of aortic homograft surgery. TEE on 2/20/18 showed severe RV hypokinesis and severe TR.
3. HIT. Developed HIT post-operatively after aortic homograft replacement in 2/18.
4. Coronary artery disease. Preoperative cardiac catheterization on 03/11/2117 demonstrated 30% focal narrowing in the left main; proximal 30% lesion in the LAD; 50% lesion in D1; mid 50% lesion in the left circumflex, and normal RCA. 
5. Dry gangrene of right 3rd digit of right foot thought to be secondary to an embolic complication of IABP versus HITT.
6. Hypertension. 
7. Hyperlipidemia.

	Assessment and plan:
   55 y/o Columbian male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, severe AS s/p AVR (St. Judes) in 3/17 and recent composite arortic homograft replacement for MRSA/VISA endocarditis. The patient had a prolonged hospitalization with a complicated post-operative course that was notable for RV failure, ARF, HIT, vascular emboli to the right foot, and mild hyperkalemia.  At this point, he appears close to euvolemia by exam and has no evidence of decompensated CHF. HE has evidence of severe TR on exam. From an ID perspective although all recent cultures have been negative, the resistance pattern of his MRSA and persistent elevation of ESR and CRP are concerning, and he will require a prolonged course of anti-biotics as outlined by Dr. Infant-Nickel.  His ARF has resolved and his vascular embolic events to the right foot are not an active, acute issue as he only has dry gangrene and no evidence of infection. 

PLAN:
1. PVE endocarditis.  He is s/p composite aortic homograft replacement. He will need a prolonged Bactrim taper per ID. We will obtain CBC, chem panel, LFTs, ESR, CRP per ID today. He is currently on coumadin and will likely need this for a total of ~6-8 weeks post-operatively.  We will continue coumadin pending his visit with Dr. Elrod next week.
2. RV failure.  Currently well compensated with no evidence of systemic congestion.  We will continue his current dose of lasix.  Dry weight ~175-178 lbs. I will obtain a repeat TTE to reassess RV and TR severity.  We anticipate some recovery of RV function.  
3. ARF. Resolved. We will check a follow up chem panel today.
4. Right foot gangrene. Involvement of the right 3rd toe with no wet gangrene or signs of infection.  ABI testing in 3/18 showed no PAD.  He will need outpatient follow up with Dr. Werner in vascular surgery.
5. CAD. Non-obstructive disease.  Continue ASA, atenolol and lipitor.  We will hold on ACE-inhibitor given hyperkalemia issues.
6. Hyperkalemia.  Likely secondary to RTA related to Bactrim.  Ww will check follow up chem panel today.  He will need monitoring of K and we can consider kayexlate therapy if he has persistent elevations for the duration of therapy with Bactrim.   

Patient will return to clinic in 3 months for follow-up. Patient seen with Dr. Calhoun.

CXR: Clear.



CT Head: No evidence of acute intracranial process.



TTE (2090): Mild-mod MR, EF 61%, no wall motion abnormality.



A/P:  82 yo man w/ PMH significant for well-controlled DM, HTN, and lung ca s/p lobectomy, who presents with one episode of syncope.   



1. Syncope: Most likely etiology of his syncopal episode is vasovagal/ neurocardiogenic, considering the presence of prodromal symptoms (sweating, feeling warm) 5 minutes before the event.  It is possible that the patient has been dehydrated, considering the last couple days have been very humid, and he hasn't changed his fluid intake.  However, the sudden onset of his syncope and LOC for 1-2 minutes concerning for cardiogenic causes as well: including sinus brady and other arrhythmic events.  Ischemic event is less likely in this man.  EKG showed no significant changes compared to the previous one, and he has known MR evidenced on his TTE in 2090.

Other possible causes include:

  	Neurologic: unlikely with no focal neuro symptoms both witnessed at the time and currently.  However, the possibilities include basilar insufficiency.

  	Others: Finger stick glucose on the field 130, and Hct 36.8 (baseline) ruling out hypoglycemia and anemia as an etiology.  

Plan:

1)	Continue hydration overnight. 

2)     Tele monitor to detect any abnormal heart rhythm.

3)     Continue to rule out with enzymes to rule out ischemia.

4)     TTE to assess any focal site for arrhythmogenic events.

5)     TCD and carotid duplex ultrasound to rule out basilar insufficieny, although he displays no signs of it on physical exam.



2. DM: Pt diagnosed with type 2 DM approximately 12 years ago.  Seems to be in a good control, with only diet and exercise modification.  Per pt, the last HgbA1c was in 5-6 range.  

1)	Diabetic diet, RSSI.

2)     Q6h finger stick check.

3)     Check HgbA1c in AM.



3. L ankle swelling: Most likely from sprain while falling down during the syncope.  Tender to palpation and with joint movement.  No signs of infection.  Good peripheral pulses and intact sensations.

1)	L ankle plain films to rule out fracture.

2)     PT consult.



4. FEN: Electrolytes all within normal range, except slightly low Mg (1.5).  Eating PO.  On IVF for hydration.

1)	Replete Mg.  

2)     K now 3.6.  If low in AM, replete for the goal of 4.

3)     Diabetic diet for nutrition.



5. Prophylaxis: Ranitidine, heparin. 



8. Dispo: PT consult.  Anticipate home discharge.

Internal Medicine - MSIII Admission Note



Pt: Crawford, Patrick (Mary 3562Z)

MR#: 	902-15-55

Date of Admission: 10/10/92

Attending: 	Yancey, Ursula

PCP: Estep, Willa

Code status: Full





CC:  Generalized weakness + diaphoresis



HPI:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a history of diet-controlled DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago who presents with an episode of profuse diaphoresis and generalized weakness while cooking in his home at 10am this morning.  He had recently returned home from grocery shopping, carrying 6 bags of groceries up 1 flight to his apartment, and was moving about his kitchen cooking when he felt suddenly drenched in sweat.  He immediately felt lightheaded, disoriented, nauseous, generally weak, and as though he was about to faint.  He was able to walk a few steps, sit down, and rest for 15-20min before he realized his symptoms weren't resolving, called his sister, and put his head on the table and felt he could not really move because he was so weak.  He denied any CP, SOB, palpitations, flushes, fever/chills, HA, visual changes, vomiting, and focal weakness associated with the episode.  He felt he had been drinking adequate fluids, had no recent infections/cough/rhinorrhea, had no weight loss, and no exposures.  When his sister arrived he told her to call 911, and soon he was brought to the SOH ED.



One month PTA, Mr. Crawford had been in his usual state of health when he had his first ever feeling of lightheadedness and diaphoresis while grocery shopping.  Five minutes later while getting into his car, he had increasing lightheadedness and lost consciousness, falling to the ground with no head trauma.  As with today's episode, he denied prior CP, SOB, palpitations and other symptoms previously listed.  According to his sisters who were present at the time, he regained consciousness 2 minutes later, and he recalls knowing exactly where he was but not what had happened to him.  He did not lose continence of bladder or bowel.  He was brought to the ED, where his vitals were stable with a BP of 126/61 and HR 66, and was admitted for observation and workup.  Head CT was negative for an acute process, CXR was clear, EKG showed some LA enlargement and mild ST / Twave changes consistent with an EKG of 2yrs ago, negative cardiac enzymes, and a cardiac echo showing mild MR, an elongated LA, and an EF of 68%.  At the time of discharge he was instructed to stop taking Prazosin for his BPH and instead take Flomax.



In the past month, Mr. Crawford has had no repeat syncopal episodes, but many episodes of diaphoresis with very mild lightheadedness.  He reports that at least every few days he either has a brief diaphoresis episode during his daily activities, or sometimes a profuse diaphoresis that can occur while lying in bed and causing him to change his clothes and bedsheets.  He has had no other symptoms.  Of note, this morning he had run out of Flomax due to an insurance issue, and resumed taking 4mg of leftover Prazosin for his BPH around 6am.  He disliked the Flomax because it seemed to cause polyuria and generally made him feel 'off' in an unidentifiable way.  Currently the pt feels slightly lightheaded/'woozy', sometimes worse with positional changes, and still generally weak, with no other symptoms.

_____________________________________________________________________________________



Impression:  Pt is an 82 yo man with a h/o DM2, HTN, and a syncopal episode 1mo ago p/w diaphoresis and generalized weakness 15min after moderate activity.  Episode occurred in setting of frequent diaphoresis episodes in the past 1mo, and with medication change from Flomax to Prazosin this morning 4hrs prior to current episode.  No LOC, CP, SOB, or seizure-like activity.  No focal deficits and non-orthostatic on exam with strength intact.  Stable Hct.  Likely etiologies include:



1.	Arrhythmia, including sick sinus.  EKGs demonstrate mild LA enlargement, old V1/V2 Q waves.  Could predispose to atrial fib or conduction abnormalities.  Sick sinus not seen on EKG, but common cause of pre-syncope.



2.	Vertebrobasilar/Carotid stenosis.  Basilar territory could lead to dizziness; would expect more focal findings if carotid etiology, unless bilateral blockage.



3.	Prazosin-induced hypotension.  In light of very recent change back to Prazosin, which has more vascular/peripheral alpha-1 antagonism than does the more prostate-specific Flomax, could result in cerebral hypoperfusion.



4.	Neurocardiogenic/Carotid hypersensitivity.





Plan:



Pre-syncope:	- ROMI with 2nd and 3rd set of cardiac markers

		- Telemetry

		- 24 hr Holter monitor

		- Carotid Doppler and Posterior Transcranial Doppler

		- Check lytes, CBC + diff in a.m.

		- IVF: NS 500cc at 75cc/hr

		- Continue Lisinopril, HCTZ but discontinue Prazosin as inpatient

		- ASA qod as at home, consider    qd



DM2:		- Check glucose in a.m.

		- No insulin requirement; order diabetic diet



OA:		- Motrin 400mg bid; check BUN/Cr and U/A for evidence of AIN or ATN



Gout:		- Continue Allopurinol



Optho:		- Continue home regimen of Truopt, Artificial tears, etc.

Internal Medicine Admission Note

Name: Crawford, Patrick
MR#:  9021555
Date of Admission: 04.15.94 
PCP: Ehlers, Willa
Attending: Ward
Admitting Resident: Kimberly Ring

CC: 83 y/o man w/ known CAD presenting with near syncope

HPI:  
83 y/o man w/ CAD, (no stents), followed by Dr. Youmans, presents after an episode of diaphoresis and    upchucking    after helping his sister clean out the water in her basement (this happened Saturday am). Of note, he had one episode of diarrhea that morning. He denied any fevers or chills, or nausea or vomiting prior to this episode. When he started vigorously removing the water from the floor, he began feeling lightheaded and nauseated, and was told he was diaphoretic. He sat down on the stairs with assistance from the plumber, and    upchucked.    After vomiting he still felt dizzy and lightheaded. Ems was called, and upon arrival at the ED, he had another episode of diarrhea. At no point did he have chest pain. He did not lose consciousness. This felt somewhat similar to an episode of near syncope he had in 2092. 
In general, he is limited in his activity by his osteoarthritis. However, he walks up stairs regularly and gardens without chest pain. The only new medicine change is an increase in his norvasc. He has not been experiencing any palpitations, or shortness of breath. He denies any headache, visual changes, dysuria, abdominal pain, sore throat. He has heard that there is a bug going around, but denies sick contacts. 
ED Course:
Upon presentation to ED, HR 50, BP 141/62, 18, 99% RA, afebrile. Given aspirin, home meds, beta blocker held for bradycardia. Decided to admit despite negative troponins and no EKG changes because symptoms of dizziness when walking persisted.

Discharged from SDU on med management (beta blocker, asa, ace, and statin), with f/u w/ Dr. Youmans (who has followed since).
2. Syncope: Admitted twice 2092, first attributed to alpha blocker and dehydration, second time ruled out, but had positive adenosine mibi (see above)
. - 	3. DM2: diagnosed 2080, initially took an oral hypoglycemic agent for 6mo, but since has been managed by diet and exercise only.  HbA1c checked q3mo; most recent was around 5.0 per pt.

ECG: On floor, NSR w/ poor R wave progression (Q waves in V1 an dV2, TWI III), in ED, EKG w/ frequent PACs     

Chest xray: Clear

Assessment & Plan
83 y/o man with known CAD, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia who presents with near syncope, as well as vomiting. Certainly in someone with known CAD, cardiogenic near-syncope is most concerning, namely, MI, with atypical features. However, his EKG is unchanged, his troponins are negative, and he never had chest pain. Perhaps his light-headedness is secondary to bradycardia, as his heart rate has been in the 50s and 60s. However, I think the most likely explanation is that he has a bit of gastroenteritis, was dehydrated, and had a vasovagal response in the setting of exertion. It is worth checking orthostatics given his rigorous blood pressure regimen. There is nothing to suggest seizure or other neurologic etiologies given his story.

Syncope: Stable, no longer feeling dizzy or nauseated
Admit to telemetry and monitor overnight
Has completed MI r/o
Continue ASA, beta blocker, (w/ hold parameters), statin, ACE
Has close follow up w/ Dr. Youmans (next week), and likely does not need repeat stress test while in house
CAD: As above, will d/c on 50 PO Toprol BID per Dr. Youmans    recommendations
Diabetes: Diet controlled at home
RISS while in house with BID fingersticks to assess glucose control
Elevated WBC: Likely 2/2 gastroenteritis. Afebrile. Hemodynamically stable. U/A and chest xray negative
Will send blood cultures and stool cultures if he stools
Fen/Renal
Replete Mg
Proph: Lovenox, nexium

	Interval History:
   Mr. Crawford returns to the clinic for routine scheduled follow-up.  His cardiovascular issues include prior syncope, nonobstructive coronary disease, and hypertension. In the interval, since our last visit, he has done well from a CV perspective. He has had no episodes of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He did unfortunately have an episode of diverticulosis requiring hospitalization at Oakcrest Nursing Home. He did not require transfusion. The bleeding sounds as though it was self-limiting and has not recurred. Otherwise, his health is unchanged.  He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.

	

	Changes to Allergies
	
BRIMONIDINE TARTRATE - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]
Latex - reaction: Rash [reviewed]
no known allergies: He has no current allergies - reaction: Unknown [reviewed]

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   50, which is strong and regular
-resp. rate:   12.  He is saturating 100% at room air
-Extremities:   There is trace dependent 1+ lower extremity swelling, which is stable.
-Abdomen:   Soft and nontender.
-Cardiac:   Regular with nondisplaced PMI, 1-2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard best at the base with the crisp S2.
-Chest:   His lungs are clear.
-Neck:   Jugular venous pressure is 7 cm of water with normal AV contour.  He has 2+ carotids with brisk upstrokes.
-Heent:   Normocephalic.
-General:   He is alert and appropriate in no apparent distress
-BP: 138/72    in the right arm seated


	EKG:
   Sinus bradycardia at 50. Delayed R-wave progression. Leftward axis. Nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities.

Selected recent labs:
	
		
	


	Impression:
   1.) Nonobstructive CAD
2.) Neurocardiogenic syncope
3.) Hypertension


	Assessment and plan:
   Overall he is doing well his cardiovascular issues are stable.  His blood pressure slightly above goal but given his past syncopal tendencies with aggressive lowering will hold off on any med changes for now.  I will see him back in six months, sooner if new issues arise.

In the interval, since our last visit, he continues to do well from a CV perspective. He has had free of chest pain, pressure, tightness, orthopnea, PND, progressive lower extremity swelling, or claudication. He has had no recurrent symptomatic diverticulosis. He remains fairly limited due to his osteoarthritis but continues to perform all ADLs successfully.  He is unfortunately not able to do any gardening this year due to progressive joint pain and stiffness. He was recently seen by Dr. Powers (nephrology) after a recent mild bump in his creatinine. His renal workup is ongoing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Qin is a patient of Dr. Potter's, who is in today for urgent care.  He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.  Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.  Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.  Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms.  He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16.  He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia.  Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever.  He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.  He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.  He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.  This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for osteoarthritis, hypertension and other noncontributory problems.



MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, atenolol, Lipitor and vitamin E.



ALLERGIES:  None.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, he is alert and oriented.  His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4.  Sinuses: Non-tender.  Nasal turbinates: Benign.  Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen.  Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema.  Neck: Supple, without adenopathy.  I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.  Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having.  I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.  He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.

EDVISIT^42817774^AARON, JEAN^08/04/77^VALENTIN, IDA

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post fall, right shoulder pain.

I saw the patient with Dr. Andrew Newhouse.  Please see his note for

further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63-year-old female

who presents after mechanical trip and follow at work today and

hit her forehead.  No loss of consciousness, no headache, no

visual changes, no upper or lower extremities, paresthesias or

weakness.  She fell onto her right shoulder, is complaining about

pain at that area.  No focal weakness, no neck pain, no back

pain, no chest pain, shortness of breath, no belly pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes,

hypercholesterolemia, neuropathy, and diverticulitis.

MEDICATIONS:  Currently on Novolog, verapamil, lisinopril,

amitriptyline, and aspirin.

ALLERGIES:  No known allergies

SOCIAL HISTORY:  One pack per day smoker and does not drink.  She

denies IV drug use.  She lives alone.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per resident's note and my HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, and nontoxic but does

appear uncomfortable.  Afebrile, vital signs are notable for a

blood pressure of 185/79, O2 saturation 99% on room air,

respiratory rate 18, and pulse 89.  HEENT exam:  Normocephalic

and atraumatic.  No facial tenderness.  No cervical spine

tenderness in the midline.  Lungs:  Clear anteriorly.  No TLS

spine tenderness in the midline.  Heart:  Regular rate and

rhythm.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, and nondistended.  Her right

shoulder that is held by her side, she has exquisite tenderness,

unable to really move it.  She has intact axillary nerve

sensation, full strength in her hand and fingers.  Alert and

oriented x3.  Normal mood and affect.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient thought she hit her

forehead does not have signs or symptoms suggestive of

intracerebral injuries.  I do not feel she needs imaging though

she has pain in her shoulder.  She is awake and alert and answers

questions appropriately.  She has no cervical spine tenderness in

the midline.  She did have plain films of her right shoulder that

show comminuted fracture of the right humerus involving the

surgical neck, greater tuberosity, anatomic neck with medial

displacement distal fragment.  She also had a chest x-ray that

showed some mild pulmonary vascular congestion.  The patient had

preoperative screening labs that included sodium 138, K 4.2,

chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 20, creatinine 1.4, glucose 395

and calcium 10.  White count of 27, hematocrit 41, and platelet

count 286,000.  Coags within normal limits. 

The patient will be admitted to the Orthopedics Surgery.  We will

check UA given her white count.  Of note, she did have her

differential still pending.

DIAGNOSIS:  Right shoulder fracture status post mechanical fall.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to Ortho.

CONDITION:  Stable.  She will also be treated for hyperglycemia,

which is also another diagnosis.

AARON, JEAN

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old female who presents today for hospital followup.



I admitted her to the HH on 10/03/79 with an episode of hypoxemia, which was felt to be secondary to CHF and diastolic dysfunction.  She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10/12/79.  Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11/03/79.  She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication.  Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement .  She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.  As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity.  In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation.  There was no evidence of hemolysis.  She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as  a short area of Barrett's esophagus.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.  She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.  Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.



Today, she feels reasonably well.  She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds.  She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen.  She has no chest pain or shortness of breath.  Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.



Hospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately 3, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy, Barrett's esophagus, colon polyps (tubulovillous adenoma 2079), diverticulosis adenoid hypertrophy, humeral fracture, history of marijuana use, history of alcohol abuse.



MEDICATIONS:  Reconciled today, they include:

1.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.

2.  Calcium plus D 1 tablet b.i.d.

3.  Darbepoetin is followed by Dr. Dougherty at St. Mary's.

4.  Iron sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.

5.  Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.

6.  Loratadine 10 mg daily.

7.  Metolazone 100 mg daily.

8.  Metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily.

9.  Multivitamin.

10.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.3 mg per hour (3 x 0.1 mg patches).

11.  70/30 NovoLog 60 units in the morning and 35 in the evening.

12.  Omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.

13.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq t.i.d.

14.  Ropinirole 0.25 mg daily.

15.  Simvastatin 40 mg daily.

16.  Spiriva 1 inhalation daily.

17.  Spironolactone 50 mg daily.

18.  Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.

19.  Trazodone 25 mg nightly.

20.  B-complex vitamin daily.

21.  Vitamin D3 1000 units daily.

22.  Coumadin as monitored by the Hematology Dept..



ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS:  None.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 136/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds.  General appearance:  She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy, no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  Heart irregularly irregular without murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly.  Extremities without edema.



LABORATORIES:  Drawn by the VNA on 01/04/80 shows hematocrit of 28.6, INR 2.1 on December 9, 2079 as well as potassium 3.9 and creatinine 3.2.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction.  She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds.  She will check daily weights.  I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center.  Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.

2.  Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled.  Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.

3.  COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute.  We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine at baseline of 3.2.  She will need to be watched closely.  She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.  There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.  I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system.  Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.  She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.  Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.  She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care.  this might not be a bad idea.  She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.

5.  GI.  She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.

6.  Heme.  Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.  She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.  She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January.  In the meantime,  I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's.  If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.  I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.

7.  Health care maintenance.  Labs today.  H1N1 vaccine today.  Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR.  She wishes to be full code at present.  I will see her again in 4 weeks.



Visit length 60 minutes.

NAME:    Werner, Brian  

MRN:     4097229



This patient reports approximately 3-4 years ago he had episodes of right sided

visual loss.  He thought it was only related to his right eye.  What he describes is a

right peripheral hemispheric visual loss.  He reports having a history of headaches

in the past.  It is nothing that is significantly worse than usual.  On Thursday he

reports having a mild bitemporal headache and then later that day ensuing right

peripheral loss that has lasted for the past 3-4 days.  In the past his visual loss only

lasted for about one day.  He denies any other focal neurological complaints.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.  He is on a baby aspirin a day.  He

denies any further headaches.  He denies any numbness, tingling or weakness on

one side of his body or other.  He has chronic left knee problems from an old

injury.  He is unable to bend the leg.  He has no new problems with his gait.  He

denies any symptoms of jaw claudication.  



PHYSICAL EXAM:  His exam reveals no temporal artery tenderness to palpation. 

His funduscopic exam appears normal on undilated exam.  His visual fields reveals

what appears to be consistent with right bilateral hemianopsia.  PERRLA.  EOMI. 

Cranial nerves II-XII are otherwise intact.  His motor strength is 5/5.  He has no

pronator drift.  His cerebellar exam is intact.  His blood pressure is 150/100.

Carotid - no bruit.  Cor - RRR no MGR Lungs - CTA

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Question bilateral hemianopsia.  The patient will get

scheduled for an MRI/MRA as soon as possible.  He was sent to the NDMG
Ophthalmology Clinic to confirm bilateral vs. unilateral hemianopsia (central vs. peripheral etiology) today for further evaluation plus/minus ESR and CBC at

that point in time.

On exam, he is hoarse. Temperature is 98.1, however. Throat is clear. His right CEA

is clean. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, gallops or rubs. Lungs clear.  



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Bronchitis/laryngitis. Chest x-ray today is clear. I elected to go ahead and treat

     him with doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. for the next 10 days. He does have

     follow-up with his neurosurgeon in the next 10 days or so.



(2)  Health maintenance. Double check on LFTs and A1c since his LFTs and blood

     sugars were up in the hospital. Also check a CBC.

Visit Note

Patient Name:  WERNER, BRIAN U                       MRN:  4097229
Dictated Date:  01/20/2120                        Dictated by:  Taniya Xing, M.D.

Date of Visit:  01/20/2120


Bryan returns for followup of cerebrovascular disease. A lot has happened since I last saw him in 10/2119. A CTA revealed severe stenosis of his left ICA. He is status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies and also has known vertebral disease with a history of a left occipital stroke. He subsequently was referred to Dr. Mccarthy and was scheduled to undergo left ICA stent placement in December. In November 1 morning after going to the bathroom he developed sudden onset of vertigo. His wife called 911. He continued to have positional vertigo in the emergency room such that if he sat up he would become very vertiginous and off balance but if he laid with his eyes closed. He felt better. He was found to be orthostatic and his symptoms improved according to the chart by the next day though according to the patient, it took a couple of days for his symptoms to improve significantly. An MRI of the brain was unrevealing for ischemia. Although he significantly improved he still feels &#34;a little off balance&#34;.  He is fine when he is sitting but he notes when he stands up he just &#34;feels off&#34;.  He does not feel acutely vertiginous and does not have any sense of movement but does not feel as steady as he used to on his feet. He has seen Guy in physical therapy and is working on balance therapy. He subsequently did undergo left ICA stent placement on 12/22/2119 without any complication. There was no worsening of his sense of imbalance or no new neurologic symptoms. Also of note, I neglected to mention above, that when he became acutely vertiginous in November there were no other accompanying symptoms. He was discharged after his left carotid endarterectomy on Plavix as well as aspirin that he had been on prior to his admission. He also was switched while in the hospital from hydrochlorothiazide to Inderal for blood pressure control although he was orthostatic sitting up.  Lying down he was hypertensive. He has had no new neurologic symptoms since his discharge from NDMG after his carotid endarterectomy on 12/22/2119. 

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Aspirin, gemfibrozil, nifedipine, Plavix, propranolol, ranitidine. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Pleasant, healthy-appearing 74-year-old male. Blood pressure 160/90 sitting, standing 155/90. Cranial nerve examination notable for right homonymous hemianopsia. Auscultation of the neck: Unremarkable. No bruits. There are bilateral CEA scars. Motor examination: No drift. Power 5/5 throughout. Fine finger movements intact. In the lower extremities. Power 5/5 on the right. The left he is status post left knee fusion. The left iliopsoas and dorsiflexion are full strength. His gait shows left limp due to knee fusion, but he appears steady. DTRs 1+ throughout. 

DATA: MRI of the brain in 11/2119 shows chronic left occipital lobe infarct otherwise unremarkable. CTA of the head and neck 11/14/2119 showed stable left PCA territory chronic infarct with encephalomalacia and nonspecific periventricular white matter hypoattenuation as previously described. CTA of the head showed stable moderate stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA. Stable occlusion or near occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the dural penetration to the take off of the PICA. There is reconstruction of contrast in the distal aspect. There is moderate stenosis of the distal left interdural vertebral artery with severe stenosis at the left vertebrobasilar junction and also unchanged.  Stable moderate to severe stenosis within the right intradural vertebral artery.  Mild areas of stenosis within the basilar artery and left T1 and T2 segments also unchanged. A CTA of the neck shows a short segment of severe stenosis of the proximal left ICA, which is stable since the most recent study.  The right carotid artery demonstrates no significant stenosis. Dominant right vertebral artery with hypoplastic left vertebral artery demonstrates moderate stenosis at its origin and diffuse areas of moderate stenosis of the throughout unchanged. Mild to moderate right subclavian artery stenosis just proximal to the vertebral artery take off unchanged. Multiple thyroid nodules as described since most recent study. New ground glass nodule in the lower lobe the right lung, which is likely inflammatory in nature. Followup chest x-ray 11/14/2119 was unremarkable. Cardiac ultrasound shows evidence of a PFO, which is now noted following performance of Valsalva maneuver not previously noted.  In 09/2113 Holter monitor was unremarkable. 

IMPRESSION: A 74-year-old male with long-standing cerebrovascular disease and history notable for left occipital lobe infarct with vertebrobasilar disease as described above, status post bilateral carotid endarterectomies with recent restenosis on the left treated with stenting in 12/2119.  He has been doing well considering. 

The cause of his episode of vertigo and imbalance is unclear.  It is difficulty to tease out whether or not this was a posterior circulation TIA versus small stroke not detected on MRI versus vasovagal etiology. He checks out well today and I do not find any new findings on examination and his walking is steady though subjectively he feels he is not quite back to baseline. Agree with Plavix added to his aspirin dose after his carotid stent placement. His blood pressure is a little high today. He will be following up with Dr. Kinney in 2 weeks. Recommended that he continue to work with Guy on vestibular therapy. 

Followup with me in 3 months.

S:   (1)  Patient here complaining of increased neck pain with paresthesias of her

          left arm and tingling of her third and fourth left fingers.  This often

          occurs at the end of the week, when has been at the computer all week

          and then has to take her Vioxx and Norflex for the next two or three

          days, into the weekend.  Patient becoming very frustrated regarding this.

          Did not keep follow-up with Dr. Espinosa, the neurosurgeon she

          initially saw. 



     (2)  Diabetes: Patient had her first eye exam yesterday with Dr. Dunn, who

          actually is an optometrist.  He is referring her to a retinal specialist, due

          to a question of cystoid macular edema, due to diabetic retinopathy and

          some possible borderline intraocular pressures.  The patient is very

          concerned regarding this. Is worried about her heart and kidneys, now

          that she is having problems with her eyes.  Is trying to stick to her diet,

          but is worried. Blood sugars at home have been mostly in the 200's,

          occasionally high 100's. Patient does not bring her record with her. 



O:   Patient refuses to be weighed. BP, RA sitting 128/90. Lungs: Clear to A&P.

     COR: AP 96, NSR. Positive tenderness and spasm to left trapezius muscle.

     Feet: No lesions. Dorsalis pedis pulses 2+ bilaterally.  



A/P: (1)  Chronic neck and shoulder pain with intermittent paresthesias, with

          MRI showing some chronic degenerative changes, but also mild

          impingement of the subarachnoid space, possibly even at the cord at C5-6.

          Lengthy discussion with patient regarding this being chronic problem

          and need to follow up with Dr. Espinosa.  Will refer to P.T., not only

          for therapy, but also to re-evaluate ergonomics of her work site, as this

          may help. Continue all other medications, with ice, heat and home

          exercises.  Consulted with Dr. Moses, who suggested a TENS Unit may

          be helpful.  Will discuss further with patient. 



     (2)  AODM: Now with diabetic retinopathy. Lengthy discussion of 20 to 30

          minutes with patient regarding implications of this, as well as need for

          better diabetic control, especially, as poorly-controlled diabetes is quietly

          harming both her heart and her kidneys, as well as her blood vessels. 

          Patient seems more motivated now to try to adhere to diet and exercise.

          Refer to Dr. Larry Kowalski, a retinal specialist, as soon as possible. Patient

          promises to do her bloodwork for her RFT's, fasting lipids, FBS,

          hemoglobin A1C, as well as urine microalbumin.  Will follow up with

          Dr. Moses and with me afterwards.

CC: fall with LOC



HPI: Pt is a 56 yo woman with a PMH significant for multiple cardiac risk factors, including IDDM, with a HbA1C of 10.7 earlier this month, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, whose insulin dose was increased 3 weeks ago.  Her blood sugars have subsequently been low, reaching the 50s on several occasions.  At these times, she experiences diaphoresis and dizziness.  The pt took her morning insulin as usual, ate her normal breakfast, and at 4:30pm was walking to the kitchen when she got dizzy and felt her legs    turn to jelly.     She felt herself falling, yelled out to her son and landed on her left arm.  She lost consciousness.  Her son found her unresponsive and witnessed her vomit twice, drool, mumble and lose bladder continence.  She regained consciousness a few minutes later and was placed in an ambulance, where her BS was found to be 91.  She was brought to the DDCH ED, where plain films showed a fractured left humerus and a head CT was negative for bleed.     



She denies CP, SOB or palpitations.  At baseline, the pt is able to walk one mile and climb three flights of stairs without SOB or CP.

Studies:

Plain film humerus- fracture through the diaphysis of the left humerus.  There is lucency which could represent underlying lesion.  

CXR- NAD

Head CT- negative

10/90- stress- 7 mets- no chest pain, no ECG changes, imaging- apparently reversible anterior defect- likely breast attenutation

5/90- echo- EF 75%, no valvular abnl.

EGD- 11/93- erythematous gastropathy



Assessment: 56 yo woman with chronically high blood sugars, who now, in the setting of recently increased insulin and low blood sugars, presents with fall and LOC, likely a hypoglycemic seizure.



Plan:

Syncope- most likely etiology hypoglycemic seizure.  Given pt's markedly elevated HbA1C, blood sugars likely very high chronically.  Now with tight glycemic control, including blood sugars in the 50s, pt likely seized.  Other worrisome etiologies would include cardiac- has multiple risk factors, but no data supporting CAD (enzymes negative, ECG no change, no signs/symptoms of CHF, no valvular disease, no history of arrhythmias)  Will continue rule out MI.  Don't think TTE necessary.  Also, could be cerebrovascular disease, although imaging of cerebral vasculature has been mostly normal.  Head CT negative for bleed.  Will discuss EEG with pt's neurologist in am.



Left humerus fracture- reduction by ortho in ED.  Pt should sleep in upright position (per ortho).  Percocet for pain control.



DM- have cut pt's home insulin in 1/3 (do not want to run too low).  SSI for additional coverage.



HTN- cont outpt anti-hypertensives.



Anemia- stable- iron not deficient.  



Hyperlipidemia- cont statin.



Prophylaxis- nexium, fragmin vs ambulation.

PROBLEMS:
1.   Multinodular goiter.
2.   Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
3.   Diabetic retinopathy.
4.   History of smoking.
 
MEDICATIONS:  Ecotrin, 1 q.d., Synthroid, 0.5 mg. q.d.  Patient has not 
been taking in 3 months after running out of prescription.  Micronaise 5 
mg. q.d.  Premarin 0.625 mg. q.d.
 
HPI:  Mrs. Stephenson returns for her follow-up visit for her diabetes and 
multinodular goiter.  She says that she has no new complaints since the 
last visit.  She denies any episodes of pyuria, dyspnea, weight loss or 
weight gain.  She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain and ankle 
edema.  She has seen her ophthalmologist several months ago and has 
another visit today.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure is 125/90.  There are no new changes on 
exam.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  Patient's hemoglobin A1c in 2/74 
     was 10.8.  Will recheck hemoglobin on this visit as well as the UA 
          ketones and hemoglobin once she remains elevated on the 
     present dose of Micronase will consider increasing.
 
2.   Multinodular goiter.  Patient's right hemithyroid has unchanged on 
     exam.  She has been off of her Synthroid for 3 months.  We will 
     refill her prescription and reassess her goiter after 6 months of 
     treatment.
 
3.   Diabetic retinopathy.  Ophthalmology follow-up today.
 
4.   Smoking history.  Patient quit smoking in 2/74 after using a 
     Habitrol patch and has not smoked since.
 
5.   Hypercholesteremia.  Patient had an elevated cholesterol of 319 and 
     triglycerides of 751.  Although these were not fasting levels.  It 
     is suspected the patient will need to have medications to control 
     her hypoglycemia.  Will set her up with the Nutrition department 
     for now for a modified diet.
                                              7-20-74
 
 
 
6.   Elevated blood pressure.  Blood pressure is borderline at this 
     point.  Will recheck and have the patient adhere to her no-added 
     salt diet.
 
Patient will follow up in 10/74.  Will call the patient if her Micronase 
dose needs to be increased.  She will have an appointment with the 
nutritionist in order to start a no-added salt and low cholesterol diet.

HPI:  Ms. Stephenson is a 57-year old woman who has a history of multinodular 
goiter status post a hemithyroidectomy 7 years ago, and 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years complicated 
by diabetic retinopathy.  She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin 
replacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with 
Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse 
practitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively 
compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease 
process appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a 
day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes 
intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood 
sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the 
non-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, 
excessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid 
medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out 
of the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and 
has not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, 
palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about 
potentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific 
complaints.  She has a good energy level.
 
Social History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Habits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has 
been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning 
on stopping this.
 
Physical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam 
reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe 
without specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her 
oropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is 
obese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her 
skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral 
edema.
 
Assessment/Plan:
 
1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a 
     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about 
     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine 
     dipsticks.  
 
2)   History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her

3)   Routine health screening.  She does not need a pap smear.  She has 
     had a TAH; however, I will perform a mammogram on her today.  She 
     will come back and see me in one month to get the results of these 
     tests, and we will make treatment decisions at that time.

Ms. Stephenson comes in for discussion of her stress test last week, which 
was positive.  She went 9 minutes and 11 seconds on a modified Bruce to 
a maximum heart rate of 131, which was 81% of predicted.  She had 1mm 
and 2mm ST depressions, which was predictive of significant coronary 
disease.  She continues to have chest pain only when she is exercising 
vigorously, which is rapidly walking.  She vehemently denies that she 
has any chest pain at rest or with less exertion.
 
We began a discussion of what kind of intervention she might like to 
have, and we will continue this over time, but currently she is not 
interested in intervention if we can manage her medically.
 
PLAN:  I will start her today on atenolol 25mg and on an aspirin.  She 
refused nitroglycerine because she did not feel that she had any need 
for taking it.  She will come back in one week to see how her pulse is 
on atenolol.  
 
Today blood pressure was 164/82 and her pulse was 80.  
 
We will increase the atenolol as tolerated.  I will continue to work 
with her strenuously on risk factor modification.  Her other risk 
factors include diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, though 
her cholesterol is current well controlled with an LDL of 95.  Her 
diabetes is not as well controlled, and I think I will consider sending 
her to Olivia Orosco for further management of this.
 
She will return to see me in a week's time, and she understands that hip 
if she has increasing chest pain that she should call me or come to the 
hospital.

EDVISIT^92819461^STEPHENSON, BREDNA^07/15/86^WALLACE, VELMA

I saw this patient on 07/15/2086 in conjunction with Dr. Echols. 

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 68-year-old female with leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known coronary

artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes, status

post left fem-pop bypass and transmetatarsal amputation of her

left foot at the Siouxland on 05/02/2086.  This was complicated by

acute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and

labile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for

approximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh

erythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. 

She has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty

ambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild

stomach upset.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,

diabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and

D1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,

hydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,

Synthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no

acute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: 

Temperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood

pressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For

full physical exam findings, please see the resident's written

note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic

exams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam

reveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. 

Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. 

Musculoskeletal exam:  The fem-pop incision on the left leg is

concerning for purulent drainage along the incision site,

especially along the upper aspect of the upper thigh.  There is

approximately an area of 8 x 5 cm of erythema, induration, and

tenderness surrounding the area draining purulent material.  The

patient also has a transmetatarsal amputation.  The wound there

is clean, dry, and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count of 10.9, BUN and creatinine ratio of 30:1.4 respectively.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Surgery was consulted regarding

this likely wound infection.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and

Flagyl were their request for antibiotics.  These were

administered in the Emergency Department, and the patient will be

admitted for likely operative debridement of this wound

infection.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Postsurgical infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetes.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Peripheral vascular disease.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted.

Most recent labs from October 22, 2081 reveal an ALT of 13, AST 19,

alkaline phosphatase 78, bilirubin 0.3, creatinine 3.1, albumin

3.6.  

 

Impression:  Ms. Xanders has a history of a positive hepatitis C

antibody with normal LFT's.  Today, we will check a hepatitis C RNA

level to see if she is in fact viremic or whether she is one of the

lucky 15% of people who clear the virus but remain antibody

positive.  If she does not have hepatitis C RNA in her blood, than

she requires no further workup.  However, if she is RNA positive

than I would suggest a liver biopsy to assess the degree of

inflammation of fibrosis in her liver and make possible plans for

treatment with interferon/ribavirin.  She is amenable to this and

we will follow-up in two weeks by phone to discuss the results of

her RNA test.

DIAGNOSIS:
1. Hypertension.
2. Pedal edema.
3. Diabetes.

HPI: Ruth is a 42 year old woman who presents for follow
up of medical issues as well as for new pedal edema over the
past 2 weeks.  When I saw her a few weeks ago, she was very
dehydrated and required a decrease in dose of her Lasix due
to symptoms of dehydration as well as a rise in her
creatinine and BUN.  She responded well to this and then did
well for a week or so.  Then she saw Dr. Vuong who
increased her dose of Lasix back to 20 mg in the evening. 
Subsequently, she developed pedal edema which, at times, is
up to her knees and has been very bothersome for her.  Of
note, she started Norvasc within the past few months and it
was gradually increased to 10 mg a day.  She reports her
blood sugars have been under excellent control, ranging from
90-120s-140s especially over the past couple of weeks.  She
has had a couple of lows in the 40s over the past couple of
months.  She again has not yet followed up with Dr. Vicki
Klein as I had recommended for help with her diabetes.  She
reports her blood pressure in Dr. Vuong's office was
normal as well.  She denies any orthopnea, PND, increased
shortness of breath or dyspnea on exertion.  No fever or
chills.  Remainder review of systems negative.  She does
report sweating with meals that she is unsure how long she
has had but has noted it over the past few months. 

MEDICATIONS: As noted in the record and confirmed.

ALLERGIES: Lisinopril causes cough.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: She is a pleasant woman in no acute
distress.  Her skin is very tanned.  Blood pressure 148/62,
on repeat it is 160/70, pulse of 88, weight of 150, weight
is up about 6 pounds for her.  HEENT within normal limits. 
Neck: no JVD.  Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no
crackles or rhonchi.  Cardiovascular exam: normal S1, S2,
II/VI systolic murmur at right sternal border.  Abdomen is
benign.  Extremities: she has 1-2+ pitting pedal edema to
mid shin.  

IMPRESSION AND PLAN: 42 year old woman with:
1. New pedal edema.  Reviewing patient's recent lab results,
she does have proteinuria but it is actually improved since
the last time it was checked and also her creatinine has
improved.  I believe the pedal edema may be related to the
Norvasc.  Therefore, I advised her to stop the Norvasc and
she will call me tomorrow to let me know how she is doing as
it may take a few days to resolve.  Will consider increasing
her Lasix based on how she responds to discontinuing the
Norvasc and her labs.  Will check basic metabolic panel and
urinalysis as well.
2. Hypertension since discontinuing Norvasc.  Will start
atenolol in a low dose but advised her not to start this for
the next few days.  Will start at 12.5 mg a day and increase
to 25 mg a day and she will follow up in the next few weeks
for a repeat blood pressure check.
3. Diabetes.  The patient is strongly encouraged to make an
appointment with Dr. Vicki Klein regarding the diabetes to
see if there is anything more we can do to change her
insulin regimen.  

The patient to follow up with me by phone tomorrow and
otherwise in the next 3 weeks for a blood pressure check and
sooner if no resolution of her pedal edema.

Dear Quin,

Just a note for the records regarding Ms. Xanders's recent admission to our Cardiology Service between 08/09/2087 and 08/12/2087.  As you know, she is a lovely 47-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes, hypertension, cigarette smoking and end-stage renal disease for which she underwent transplantation in 2083. She is now under evaluation for pancreatic transplantation.  She has not had symptoms of angina or left ventricular dysfunction and LVEF has been normal.  An exercise test in July 2087 achieved 79% of the maximal predicted heart rate, no chest discomfort, but 1-mm of ST depression in the lateral leads.  Her other recent issues have included marked anemia, possibly related to her immunosuppressive drugs (negative upper and lower endoscopy) and transient hyperglycemia following a glucocorticoid bolus.

At the time of admission, the hematocrit remained in the low 20s and she was transfused in preparation for cardiac catheterization.  Appropriate bicarbonate and Mucomyst therapies were administered, and we also took advantage of the precatheterization time to reinforce the importance of smoking cessation.

Coronary angiography on 08/11/2087 demonstrated a co-dominant system with chronic occlusion of the right coronary artery with left to right collaterals perfusing that territory.  There was also a 95% stenosis of the proximal LAD.  After careful consideration of the options, Dr. Valdez placed a Cypher stent at that location successfully.  She tolerated the procedure well,  was ambulatory the following morning and the creatinine had actually improved to 2.0; the hematocrit remained ""stable"" in the mid 20s.  She will likely be discharged later today, following a discussion with the renal transplant service regarding augmenting her antihypertensive regime.

She understands the importance of uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy,  preferably for more than one year.

It was a pleasure to participate in Ms. Xanders's care.  A copy of the discharge abstract as list of discharge medications will be forwarded to you separately.

With best regards.

Sincerely yours,

EDVISIT^32612454^Barr, Nicky^01/13/93^IP, CARRIE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Xue.  I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed

the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 57-year-old with back pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a young woman with a

complicated past medical history, presents with a chronic history

of low back pain, worse over the last week.  She states that 3

years ago, she had a motor vehicle accident.  Since that time,

has had chronic low back pain.  She has been able to ambulate at

home.  Denies any fevers, rashes, history of urinary

incontinence, weakness, or numbness.  She went to EDUCARE-FARGO earlier

this week and was prescribed Percocet, comes here now because the

patient's family and the patient would like to change her care to

Lansing Dover Clinic.  Denies any numbness or weakness. 

States that she is no longer taking her pills at home.  Denies

any suicidal or homicidal ideation, has a flat affect.  Denies

any depression.  Her son, however, with whom she lives disagrees

and is very concerned that she may be depressed.  He is also very

concerned that she is not taking her medicines and that she is

not caring for herself well at home.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, and

a prior stroke.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has also had knee surgery.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per

the written note.  The patient was counseled regarding smoking

cessation.

MEDICATIONS:  Hydrochlorothiazide and Coumadin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert in no acute

distress.  Vital signs are within normal limits as documented. 

For full physical exam findings, please see the resident's

written note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, respiratory, cardiac,

rectal, and abdominal exam are within normal limits as

documented.  Skin exam is remarkable for erythematous changes in

the groin where the patient has significant skin fold due to

obesity.  Musculoskeletal exam is otherwise unremarkable.  Range

of motion is full.  Strength and tone is normal.  The patient

does have a positive straight leg raise on the left, reproducing

her back pain.  Neurologically, the patient has a flat affect but

is oriented with intact cranial nerves and no focal neurologic

deficit in either motor or sensory distribution.  She does,

however, walk with a limp, which is chronic for her.

LABORATORY DATA:  White blood count is slightly elevated at 11.3.

 BUN and creatinine is also significantly elevated at 26 and 1.1,

respectively.  Potassium is also quite low at 2.9.  Urinalysis is

positive with 35-40 white blood cells, 15-20 red blood cells, and

2+ bacteria.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  My chief concern for this patient

is her inability to care for self at home.  It is apparent that

her son is interested in helping her and do so, but the patient

on physical exam has some obvious lack of hygiene and I am

concerned that potentially the patient has either an underlying

neurologic or psychiatric issue that is preventing her from

thriving at home.  Psychiatry initially was consulted.  Their

impression was that the patient may have neuro behavior problem

that needs further outpatient workup, and she was referred to a

specific providers within the next 2 weeks.  The patient was

treated with potassium chloride for her hypokalemia.  Care

coordinator and social services were consulted.  The patient will

have a home safety evaluation and will be referred for primary

care services, was discharged with a cane for ambulation, and

will likely also receive VNA Services to help her with medication

compliance and other ADLs.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSES:

1.  Chronic low back pain.

2.  Hypokalemia.

3.  Urinary tract infection.

4.  Failure to thrive.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Satisfactory.

Personal Data and Overall Health

Mrs. Barr is a 57  years old lady with multiple significant medical problems new to KEKELA.



Chief Complaint

She is here today for a Physical  Exam



History of Present Illness

Patient has HO HTN for years and CVA. She has had 4 CVAs in the past. First one in 2087, 2088, 2089 and 2090. She was not taking her BP meds those times and she has been smoking 1 PPD since then despite being told she had to quit smoking.

She was seen at the LDC ED twice in Jan 13 and 21/05. First visit she was taken by her son after he couldn't take care of her anymore. Not doing anything at home, not caring about anything. Was seen by psych and arranged to have a PCP, spoke about therapy as well. 

Then 1/21/93 seen for chest pain. EKG negative and was D/C home. Had a MIBI done 1/23/93

    

     1.  Clinical Response:  Non-ischemic.

     2.  ECG Response:  No ECG changes during infusion.

     3.  Myocardial Perfusion:  Normal.

     4.  Global LV Function:  Normal.





She states she is supposed to be on Coumadin for the strokes and she self D/C it last year. Previous PCP at EDUCARE-FARGO Dr. Nancy Odell. Changing to KEKELA because her son thinks she can get better help here. 



She looks depressed and I mentioned that to her. She states ""I always have looked the same"". After speaking for her for 20 minutes she tells me that at age 28 she had a miscarriage of her twins. She was jumping rope and after coming back home her husband told her if she was trying to kill the twins. That night she had a miscarriage and one baby was born in the toilet and the otherone was taken by the EMTs. She was 4 months pregnant. She had therapy then and meds and felt a little better. Her husband died 6 years ago and before he died he reminded her that she had killed his twins. She felt bad and has felt bad since. She cries during interview.

She worked for many years for mcilhenny company, Fire Chief and retird last year.

                                              9-5-67
 
 
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Vance is a 45 year old woman with diabetes, 
porphyria and coronary artery disease, who came in today for annual visit.  
 
HPI:  
1.   Pain in right hand.  The patient has a Dupuytren's contraction in the 
     right hand.  She did have one in the left hand for which she had 
     surgery in June, 2064.  The surgery was performed by Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg.  At that time, she also had an ulnar nerve decompression.  
     She had trigger fingers in the left index and ring finger as well, 
     which were repaired.  She is a Transport Operations Supervisor that uses her hands 
     extensively and is very concerned about the pain in her right hand.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  She only rarely checks her blood sugars.  They 
     tend to run about 160.  She has had diabetes for 28 years.  She takes 
     NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m. and CGI 10 units sub q q.a.m.  She 
     is not on an evening dose.  Her last ophthalmology visit was in 6/66.  
     She denies any problems with peripheral neuropathy.  
3.   Coronary artery disease.  She is status post single vessel CABG in 
     9/61 for isolated lesion.  Since then she has had no angina.  She has 
     been on no medications for coronary artery disease since 2063.  
4.   Left breast lesion.  She was found to have a breast mass in 12/66 and 
     underwent wire localization and biopsy.  At that  time, she had micro 
     calcifications on her mammogram at that time.  The past report 
     revealed atypical ductal hyperplasia only.
 
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  NPH insulin 25 units sub q q.a.m., CGI 10 units sub 
q q.a.m., Tylenol p.r.n., aspirin 85 mg PO q.d.
 
PHYSICAL EXAM:  Blood pressure 114/50.  Weight 111.5 lbs.  General 
appearance: healthy appearing middle aged woman in no acute distress.  
HEENT: no retinopathy was noted on my exam.  Neck: no thyromegaly.  Chest 
is clear to P&A.  She has sternotomy scars present.  Cardiac: normal S1, 
S2.  Breasts: right breast is normal, left breast reveals surgical 
incisional scars at 12:00 and 3:00 O'clock.  She does have a firm mass 
below the incisional scar at 3:00 P.M.  Abdomen: midline scar in the lower 
abdomen is evident from her C section.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  
Extremities: no edema.  Pelvic exam: external genitalia are normal.  
Vagina, cervix, fundus, adnexae all normal.
 
IMPRESSION: 
1.   Painful right hand.  The patient was referred back to Dr. Peter 
     Vandenberg for evaluation for surgery.
2.   Diabetes mellitus.  I asked the patient to keep track of her blood 
     sugars for then next month and to return to see me.  I also checked a 
     BUN and creatinine as well as a urine micro albumen.  We checked her 
     annual cholesterol.  Her previous cholesterol was done 5/66 and was 
     203.  She was referred to Dr. Nava for a good retinal exam.

                                              9-5-67
 
 
 
3.   Status post CABG.  I started her on atenolol 25 mg PO q.d. given that 
     she does have coronary artery disease, and there is a question as to 
     whether or not she had an MI in 2061, which she will return in one 
     month for blood pressure check and also to review her blood sugars.

RE:  Jennifer Vance

     MR #542-66-00-3

 

Dear Vester:

 

Mrs. Vance presents to the office today for general cardiac

evaluation.  As her history is well known to you, I will repeat it

briefly for our records.  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with

a history of variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes and

significant coronary artery disease.  In 2061, after a four to five

day history of retrosternal chest discomfort, she was admitted to

the Barton Memorial Hospital where coronary angiography

revealed a 95% proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis. 

She underwent balloon angioplasty of her LAD times two with

inadequate results.  She therefore was taken electively for

coronary artery bypass graft surgery with placement of a left

internal mammary artery to her LAD.  She subsequently continued to

have chest discomfort and underwent repeat cardiac catheterization

in May of 2063 at which time coronary angiography revealed a 60%

stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery and a 50%

stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The catheterization

report does not indicate the status of her left internal mammary

artery graft.  Since then, she has continued to have episodes of

intermittent abdominal discomfort.  She recently has undergone an

extensive evaluation by the gastroenterology service for her

abdominal pain without specific pathology being discovered.  Trials

of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been ineffective. 

In November of 2068, she underwent a Bruce protocol stress test

exercising for eight minutes to a peak heart rate of 131, peak

blood pressure of 188/82 stopping because of fatigue.  She had no

ischemic changes on electrocardiogram.  Over the past two weeks

however, she has noticed that her chronic abdominal pain syndrome

(which she often describes as feeling like indigestion) now

includes radiation to her left shoulder.  The pain is not

exacerbated by position, time of day or any particular activity. 

The pain does not awaken her from sleep nor does it occur at rest. 

Of note, her lipid profile from October 2068 indicates a

cholesterol of 229, triglyceride of 68, HDL 51, LDL of 164.  Vance, Jennifer

MR #542-66-00-3                    -2-            July 18, 2069

 

Past medical history is notable for variegata porphyria, insulin

dependent diabetes, right hand carpal tunnel syndrome, Dupuytren's

contracture and tendinitis and hypertension.

 

Medications at Present:  Enteric coated aspirin one tab po q.d.,

NPH insulin 25 units sub q qAM, CZI 10 units sub q qAM.

 

Allergies:  None.

 

Cigarettes - none.  Ethanol - social.

 

Family history is notable for her father dying from carcinoma,

mother dying of colon cancer, question coronary disease, one

brother having a myocardial infarction at age 25, another brother

dying from melanoma age 36.  The rest of her siblings and children

have not heart disease.

 

Physical exam reveals a delightful woman in no acute distress. 

Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/64, heart rate 85 and regular,

respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 104 pounds.  The neck is

supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ with bilateral soft right

greater than left bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows a

normal S1, physiologically split S2 and a I/VI systolic ejection

murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant

diastolic murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal no

appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  

 

Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 85.  PR interval

of .12, QRS .06, QT .36, axis 85 degrees.  There are minor

nonspecific ST-T wave changes.  

 

Impression:  Mrs. Vance is a 47-year-old woman with a history of

variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, hypertension and

dyslipidemia with known coronary artery disease.  She has had a

retrosternal chest pain syndrome for the past several years and her

most recent stress test approximately one year ago did not show

significant provokable ischemia.  Nonetheless, I am concerned that

her clinical presentation may still represent recurrent ischemia. 

I therefore have scheduled her for an exercise MIBI stress test and

I will obtain both an echocardiogram and carotid noninvasive

studies.  In light of her significant dyslipidemia and insulin

dependent diabetes, I strongly recommend beginning aggressive

antilipemic pharmacologic therapy.  Unless her variegata porphyria

precludes the use of atorvastatin, I would begin this at 10 mg po

q.d.  I would target her LDL cholesterol to less than 90.  In

addition, I have started her on atenolol at 25 mg po q.d. and

I would consider beginning an ACE inhibitor again if her

porphyria does not

preclude this.  She understands that if she has evidence for

significant provokable ischemia that I would strongly encourage her

to undergo repeat coronary angiography.  Thank you very much for

allowing me to assist in her care.

 

Sincerely yours,

Dear Wanda:

 

Mrs. Vance returns for routine follow up.  At the present time,

she continues to complain of exertional angina,  and states that

she is willing to consider undergoing cardiac catheterization.  As

you know, I had suggested this to her last November.  

 

She continues now on a regimen of Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d., Paxil

20 mg p.o. q.d., Humalog 10 units sub.q. q.a.m., NPH 25 units

sub.q. q.a.m., sliding scale CZI throughout the day, isosorbide

mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Pravastatin 20 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase,

Neurontin 300 mg p.o. b.i.d., and Celexa.

 

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood

pressure right arm sitting 92/60, heart rate 75 and regular.  

Respirations 12 and unlabored.  Weight 109 pounds.  This is one

pound above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple. JVP 

is flat.  Carotids  with continuing right greater than left bruits. 

Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a normal, physiologically

split S2, and a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the

apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur.  The abdomen is

benign.  Extremities are without edema.   The pulses are intact. 

 

Electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm at a rate of 75, PR interval

.12, QRS .08, QT .34, axis 75 degrees.  There are lateral ST and T

wave changes compatible with strain or ischemia.  Compared to her

last electrocardiogram, there has been no significant change.

 

Impression:  Ms. Vance is a 48-year-old woman with a history of

variegata porphyria, insulin dependent diabetes, and significant

coronary artery disease.  She is status post intramammary artery

graft to her LAD, after developing restenosis at the site of a

balloon LAD angioplasty.  The results of the catheterization will

determine subsequent therapeutic recommendations.  She will have

her insulin dose on the morning of her scheduled catheterization.

 

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Dear Wanda:

Mr. Vance returns for followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was recently seen in the walk-in clinic in your office complaining of profound fatigue and depression.  She wonders if she was having a flare of her porphyria.  Apparently, her examination at that time was relatively benign, and no specific new findings were noted.  After talking with Dr. Vogt at that office visit, she felt modestly improved, and over the past few weeks feels that her energy level has returned to its baseline.  Lab studies obtained at that time revealed creatinine 0.9, glucose elevated at 236, hematocrit of 43, with a white count 10.  As no specific pathology was noted, she was sent home without any change in her medical regimen.

Currently, she continues on Lantus insulin 20 units subcutaneous. q.p.m., Celexa 40 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Flonase 1-2 puffs p.o. q.d., isosorbide mononitrate 60 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 600 mg p.o. t.i.d., nitroglycerin p.r.n. which she has not had to take, lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q.d., furosemide 20 mg p.o. q.d., and p.r.n. Motrin.

Physical exam reveals a thin woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 105/78, heart rate 70 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight is pending.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are 2+ with very soft bilateral referred murmurs.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, and a 1-2/6 holosystolic murmur radiating from the apex to the axilla.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished but detectable.

Electrocardiogram is pending.

Impression:  Ms. Vance remains relatively stable from a cardiovascular perspective.  However, as you know, her last echocardiogram did show evidence of at least moderate mitral regurgitation with significantly reduced left ventricular systolic function.  She has made it quite clear that under no circumstances would she consider repeat cardiac surgery to treat her valvular heart disease.  Nonetheless, I think it would be helpful for her to undergo repeat echocardiogram to help gauge the current status of her left ventricle and degree of regurgitation, which may allow for additional modifications to her therapeutic regimen.  Beyond this, her condition is actually relatively stable from a cardiovascular standpoint.  I have not further altered her medical regimen.

Thank you very much for allowing me to assist in her care.

Sincerely yours,

Narrative History

   79 yo woman who presents for f/u of: 

   1.  Urinary incontinence:  She is s/p vaginal sling procedure by Dr. Xuereb in April.  She states that she did well for about 2 weeks, but then the incontinence became worse than before.  According to her son, she saw Dr. Xuereb 10 days ago who thought the procedure was a success but that the pt had a UTI.  She started her on a month-long course of nitrofurantoin.

   2.  PAF:  The pt has not noted any cardiac symptoms.

   3.  PMR:  Her shoulder pain and weakness has disappeared since starting the Prednisone.  She has noted some facial puffiness since the medication was begun.  She is being followed in Rheum by Dr. Lisa Inge.

   4.  Mental status:  She underwent neuropsychiatric testing at BMA 3 days ago and the results have been faxed to BH.  

   5.  Social:  She is currently living in Forest Hills, an assisted living facility.  She has her own bedroom and sitting room and can shut her door for privacy.  All meals are provided for her.  She enjoys the room but at times feels ""confined.""  She had befriended a 90 yo male patient, but recently had a bad experience when he made sexual advances toward her.  She states that she would like to move back into her apartment in Stow.

Review of Systems

   No change in appetite.  No F/C, cough, SOB, CP, abd pain, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, or joint pains.

Physical Exam

   BP: 140/80    Weight: 133 lbs (up 15 lbs since 12/90)	



      General Appearance

         Appears healthy; facial swelling.



      Cor/Cardiac

         RRR; S1S2 with II/VI SEM at LLSB; no rubs or gallops.

Laboratory Data

   Neuropsychiatric testing (summary of results): Dementia of mild to moderate severity; pattern of deficits is consistent with primary neurodegenerative process (i.e., Alzheimer's); will impact her ability to function independently.

Assessment and Plan

   1.  Incontinence:  F/u with Dr. Xuereb after completing course of nitrofurantoin.

   2.  Cardiac:  Stable on metoprolol, sotalol, and digoxin.

   3.  PMR:  Continue low-dose prednisone.  Discussed facial bloating as side effect.  Plan according to Dr. Inge is to taper prednisone slowly over a year.  Will check ESR today.

   4.  Depression:  Much better.  No physical signs/sx of depression right now.  Continue Remeron.

   5.  Dementia:  It was suggested in the neuropsych evaluation that a cognitive enhancing medication may benefit the pt.  Will discuss starting Aricept with pt's cardiologist, Dr. Jankowski, to make sure it will not impact her Afib.

   6.  Hyperlipidemia:  Lipitor was d/c'd at some point over past year.  Will check chol/HDL today since she is not fasting.

   7.  Social:  Discussed results of neuropsych evaluation with patient.  Discussed issues of living alone and how she would need 24 hour supervision.  Pt not sure if this situation would be better than assisted living.  Discussed these issues with pt's son, Villatoro, over the phone after the visit.  Will fax him paperwork for health care proxy.

 Patient says she takes prune juice daily for bowels to avoid constipaiton.

 Asking her about scar on hypogastruim she said was a bladder operation.

   

 Pertinent PMH:

    Is diabetic on glyburide

    Has been on prednisone for PMR, tpaering dose. Current dose per RN sheet is total 8 mg per day prednisone.

    Although mention of prior colonoscopy is made, I could not find record of results to see if known diverticuli

    A more recent colonoscopy attempt failed do to poor clean- out and patient intolerance

Impression: Pateint appears well and has minimal physical findings (minimal pain on palp LLQ) but given

                       that she is on prednisone which may mask symptoms, as well as diabetic and dementia

                       could also obscure exam as well as history, I am concerned about acute diverticulitis.



                 I am unable to find if known diverticuli in past.



Plan:      To get Abdo/Pelvic CT now

              Will get CBC with diff, chemistries including LFT's, amylase

Narrative History	

81 year old woman who presents for an annual exam with her daughter-in-law, Franchesca Justice.  They would like to discuss the following issues:

1.  Shoulder pain:  She continues to have bilateral shoulder pain, but the L shoulder is worse than the right.  She has been taking Prednisone 9 mg a day for a long time but has not f/u with Rheum for about a year.  She did have a cortisone in the L shoulder in the past.  She is able to lift her arms over her head.

2.  Depression:  Her family feels that she is doing much better on the Effexor than the Celexa.  The pt has seen Dr. Ramsey in Psych a few months ago.  

3.  Dementia:  Dr. Ramsey recommended continuing on the Aricept.  Overall, the pt's family feels that her memory is worsening, although some days are better than others.  She has not had any other episodes of halluncination, as was described in an email from her son a couple weeks ago.  The pt states that she is sleeping and eating well, but her family thinks that she sleeps too much.

4.  Eyelid surgery:  She is scheduled to have surgery on her eyelids on May 25.  The drooping of the lids is so bad by the end of the day that she is unable to read.

5.  Incontinence:  She has now had 3 collagen implants for her bladder.  The pt does not think that she is any better, but when Dr. Xuereb tested her a few months ago, she saw some improvement.

6.  Diarrhea:  She has about 2 soft BM's a day, but she also has intermittent diarrhea.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if the pt might be lactose intolerant.  She is not having any blood in her stool.  She does not have any diarrhea in the middle of the night.  She has never gotten a colonoscopy since the last attempt just prior to her hospitalization 2 years ago.

7.  DM:  The pt states that she does not eat much sugar, but her daughter-in-law thinks that she probably does consume a fair number of sweets.

8.  Hyperlipidemia: She has been on Zocor 20 mg QD but is not following a low fat diet.

9.  Medication compliance:  The pt's family is not sure if she is taking her medications every day.  They pay a private nurse to come lay out the meds in the am, but the pt is often asleep when she comes and will not get up to take the meds at that time.

10.  Onychomycosis:  The pt has a fungal infection in her great toes.  Her daughter-in-law is wondering if there is anything topical to treat this with.  The pt gets regular pedicures.

Social History	

Lives in Forest Hills, an assisted living facility; never smoking; Etoh- rare- she might have one drink if she goes to her son's house for dinner; exercise- walking.



Family History	

Family History: mother died at 89 of ""old age""; father died of unknown causes; no breast or colon ca; brother is s/p MI before age 60; + DM.



Review of Systems	

No change in weight, appetite.  No dizziness, F/C/N/V, cough, SOB, CP, abd pain, constipation, dysuria, joint pain.



Physical Exam	

BP: 122/70		Weight:	132 lbs. (down 8 lbs) 	Height: 5'2""

GENERAL: 	Elderly woman with Cushingoid facies.

SKIN:		NL turgor, no abnormal lesions.

HEENT:	            NL eyes, lids drooping over eyes about 1/2 way; NL oropharynx

NECK:	            No thyromegally, no nodes; carotids 2+ bilat without bruits.

CHEST:	            Clear lungs, NL frame

COR:		NL S1S2, no murmur, rubs, or gallops.

BACK:	            No spinal tenderness.

EXT:		No edema, clubbing, or cyanosis; DP pulses 2+ bilat

NEURO:	            NL MS, NL gait



Assessment and Plan	

1.  PMR:  Discussed the importance of regular f/u with Dr. Inge.  We should aim to get the dose of Prednisone decreased.  Will check ESR today.  Franchesca will make sure appt is scheduled with Dr. Inge.

2.  Depression:  She seems better.  Continue Effexor. 

3.  Dementia:  Will continue Aricept.  Discussed keeping pt stimulated with outings, family visits.  Her excessive sleeping is likely a combination of several factors, including her multiple medications, depression, and possibly the dementia.

4.  Eyelid surgery:  Pre-op exam today.  Will order complete metabolic panel, CBC, and EKG.

5.  Incontinence:  It is not likely that she will be able to have any more procedures at this point.  Some of the incontinence may be secondary to dementia rather than pure stress incontinence.

6.  Diarrhea:  Discussed trying a lactose-free diet for a week to determine if lactose-intolerance may be playing a role.  Will set up a virtual colonoscopy since the pt had such a bad experience with the sedation for her colonoscopy 2 years ago.

7.  DM:  Check glucose and Hgb A1C.

8.  Hyperlipidemia: Check fasting lipids- she will get them drawn at Dameron Hospital.

9.  Medication compliance: Discussed trying to get nurse to come a little later in the day so that pt could be observed while taking her medication.

10.  Onychomycosis:  I do not think oral medication would be a good idea for this patient because the risks of hepatotoxicity outweigh the benefits.  Will refer her to Podiatry for care of the toenails since the pt has a h/o peripheral neuropathy.

11.  Health maint:  Order mammo to be done at DH; TSH.

CC:  altered mental status



HPI:  83yo female with a h/o dementia, HTN, DM, Afib, PMR, and chronic diarrhea sent from her assisted living facility for altered mental status and suspected UTI.  Per the patient's son, the staff at her facility has noted the patient to be more confused over the last 3 days.  She has had more frequent episodes of fecal incontinence with soiling of her bed and carpet. Some blood was also noted in her toilet. Her son also reports that she has been less awake than usual and has had some congestion and coughing.  She has had no fevers, chills, chest pain, sob, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. A urinalysis was reportedly positive at her assisted living facility and the patient was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. 



At baseline, the patient is generally quite confused.  She knows her name and often location but not the date/year and talks frequently of her late husband and parents whom she believes are still alive. Her assisted living facility has recently suggested that she be transferred to their higher level of care program.

Blood cultures were sent. The patient was treated with levofloxacin 500mg po and 3LNS, as well as many of her home meds, including Lopressor, Sotalol, prednisone, iron, thiamine, folic acid, mvi, calcium, glyburide, and effexor. Aspirin was held. She was transfused one unit of PRBCs and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

CXR 1/29/95: minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis



EKG: aflutter with variable block, no ischemic changes



A/P:  83 yo female with dementia, HTN, DM, AF, and PMR with worsening mental status over several days. Per report, her urinalysis was positive at her living facility, however there is no evidence of urinary or other infection now (now WBC or fever; CXR neg, Ucx/Blcx NG). Suspect her altered mental status is secondary to progressive dementia and dehydration. The patient was also noted to have blood in her stool at home and a 10 point Hct drop in the emergency department. While the patient did get 3L of fluid in between which could cause dilutional anemia, given the patient's history of blood in stool and guaiac positivity, will work-up possible GI bleed. 



1.	Decreased Hct- GIB v. dilutional.  Does have h/o diverticulitis.

a.	Serial Hcts q8

b.	2 large bore IVs at all times

c.	Consider GI consult if Hct continues to drop for possible EGD/colonoscopy (although pt has had multiple unsuccessful colonoscopy attempts in past)

d.	Nexium 40mg po qd

2.	AMS- likely progressive dementia in setting of dehydration. 

a.	F/u urine and blood cultures

b.	Hold antibiotics as no clear source of infection

c.	Check TSH, B12, folate, LFTs, lytes

d.	Hydrated in ED

e.	Check head CT

f.	Attempt to wean effexor; consult geri-psych per attending

3.	Rhythm- has h/o afib and SVT, now in aflutter with variable block. HR goes up with activity and when due for meds.

a.	Cont lopressor, sotalol, digoxin

b.	Hold aspirin for possible GIB

c.	Telemetry monitoring

4.	Hyperlipidemia- statin recently increased

a.	Check fasting lipids

b.	LFTs

5.	Diabetes- glyburide recently increased. Will hold for now in case needs to be NPO.

a.	RISS coverage

b.	Check HbA1c

6.	PMR- Cont Prednisone 5mg po qd; would like to try to taper if possible

                     LEPROSARIUM EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

KIM,DOUGLAS JR   201-63-51-2                VISIT DATE: 04/03/95

The patient was seen primarily by me. 

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Fall, right knee injury.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Mr. Killian is a very pleasant 

54-year-old gentleman, with a history of diabetes, who had a fall 

on December 18, 2094.  At the time, he sustained an injury to his 

right knee which healed and then began to break down, and he 

developed a large wound which began draining and had foul odor.  

The patient had continued difficulty ambulating and presented to 

the emergency department for evaluation.  The patient denies having 

any hardware in his knee.  No history of osteomyelitis.  No 

hardware.  No history of peripheral neuropathy.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Patient denies any fevers or chills.  No nausea 

or vomiting.  No abdominal pain.  No chest pain or shortness of 

breath.  Patient is only complaining of difficulty ambulating 

secondary to the pain.   

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Two patellar tendon repairs at EDUCARE-PULLMAN in 2083, 

repair of a patellar fracture.  Recent diagnosis of diabetes, 

atrial fibrillation.  Hypertension, high cholesterol, and positive 

PPD.  

MEDICATIONS:  Please see nurses note for list of medications. 

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN (rash). 

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient is a smoker.  He 

does not drink alcohol.  He works in engineering, and lives alone. 

Family history is noncontributory. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  Patient is awake, alert, talking 

in full sentences, in mild distress secondary to pain.  VITAL 

SIGNS:  Afebrile, temperature 99.3, respiratory rate 20, blood 

pressure 161/96, pulse 95.  HEAD:  Atraumatic.  NECK:  Supple.  

LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  No wheezes, rales or rhonchi.  

HEART:  Regular rate.  No murmurs, gallops or rubs.  ABDOMEN:  

Soft, nontender.  SKIN:  A large ulcer to the right knee, right 

over the patella, with significant amount of break-down necrotic 

tissue and purulent discharge with a foul odor.  The depth of the 

wound is difficult to assess.  Intact motor function and sensation. 

Full flexion and extension of the knee, and evidence of well-healed 

midline scar above the ulcer.  NEURO:  Intact with good pulses 

palpable throughout.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Plain film of the right knee, CT of the 

right knee, and laboratory values done.  Laboratory values 

demonstrated a white count of 14, ESR of 13, ESRP of 2.1.  Rest of 

the labs were normal except for an elevated glucose to 226.  Film 

of the knee shows patellofemoral arthritis with no evidence of 

osteomyelitis, no hardware seen.  CT of the knee showed a 

superficial ulcer to the depth of the patellar tendon but the 

patellar tendon itself was intact.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient was initially seen by 

orthopedic who felt that the ulcer was over the patellar tendon, at 

the site of prior surgeries, with no effusion or joint pain, and 

normal range of motion with joint involvement unlikely.  We are all 

very hesitant to tap this knee and it will not be done at this time 

for fear of introducing infection into the joint.  The patient is 

awaiting consultation by general surgery for probable admission and 

debridement in the operating room.  The plan at this time was to 

hold off on antibiotics.  Blood cultures were sent.  The patient is 

receiving IV fluids. 

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedics, general surgery.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Knee ulcer.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 

admitted and transitioned to ED Obs, awaiting evaluation by the 

surgical service for probable admission.  The patient is currently 

in stable and satisfactory condition, in Obs awaiting surgery 

evaluation.

EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
68yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until 2/12.
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)
DISPO: PT, OT, SLP eval

He was stabilized at Blakely House, then transferred to NAMC. At NAMC, patient had electrocardiac cath, which showed 3vd disease and Dr. Albright   s team was consulted. As pt was encephalopathic s/p arrest, he was transferred to Fremont Medical Center on 02/21/33, where he was rehabilitated and his mental status improved. At FMC, his diuretics were titrated (lasix 20 mg -> 40 mg), and psychiatry weighed in on his posthypoxic encephalopathy. He is transferred back to NAMC today in preparation for CABG, planned 3/07/33.

-Technically Difficult Study-

Sub optimal parasternal images.

MITRAL VALVE
There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence
of mitral valve prolapse.  There is no evidence of mitral regurgitation by
color and spectral Doppler.

LEFT ATRIUM
The left atrium is dilated.

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT
Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic
valve is tricuspid.  There is evidence of trace aortic insufficiency by color
and spectral Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE
The left ventricular cavity size is dilated.  The left ventricular systolic
function is moderately impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic
with regional variation.  The estimated ejection fraction is 35 %.

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.
There is an insufficient tricuspid regurgitation Doppler profile to estimate
an RV systolic pressure.

RIGHT VENTRICLE
The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function
is within normal limits.

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

2/11/33 Left Heart Cath
1) Three vessel coronary artery
disease.  The Left Main is large and has only mild irregularities.  The LAD is
diffusely diseased (30 - 40%) and has a distal 80% stenosis.  The Left Cx is
totally occluded The LCx receives faint collaterals from the LAD territority.
The ramus branch has diffuse disease with a 80% proximal stenosis and a 70% mid
stenosis.  The RCA is occluded proximally and there are right to right
collaterals. There are 80% mid and 80% distal stenoses in the RCA.
2) LV gram shows EF of 30%, with anterior/apical akinesis and inferior
hypokinesis.

Xiomara B Xanthos M.D. 
53 Barrington Avenue, Suite 700
Connell, MO 38438

Dear Dr. Xanthos:

  I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Milton Horne in my office today for evaluation of coronary artery disease.  As you know, he is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who has a history of coronary disease, admitted to GMH in June 2077 after a non-ST-elevation MI, and had a bare-metal stent placed in his LAD.  He has done well since that procedure.  He denies any exertional chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, PND, orthopnea, pedal edema, lightheadedness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.

Medications:
Aspirin 325 mg daily.
Atorvastatin 80 mg daily.
Metoprolol 100 mg daily.
Lisinopril 2.5 mg daily.
Plavix 75 mg daily.
Nexium 40 mg daily.


	Past medical history:
   Significant for,
Benign prostatic hypertrophy.
Basal cell carcinoma.
Gastroesophageal reflux.
Umbilical hernia.
Hypertension.
Hyperlipidemia.
Coronary artery disease.


	Family history:
   Significant for brother had an MI at age 68.  Father who had MIs in his 60s and a coronary artery bypass grafting.  Mother never had coronary disease.


	Social history:
   He is single.  Never married.  No children.  He never smoked.  He drinks one to two drinks a week.  He denies illicit drugs.  He also works as a Recruitment Officer.

Physical examination:
	
-Pulse:   60 and regular
-BP: 110/60  
-resp. rate:   16 and unlabored
-General:   He is a well-developed, well-nourished white male in no acute distress.  Alert and cooperative.  Oriented x 3
-Heent:   No xanthelasma, scleral icterus, proptosis, or lid lag.  Mucous membranes are moist.  Trachea is midline
-Neck:   Thyroid is nonpalpable.  Carotids are 2+ without bruits.  JVP is less than 7 cm of water
-Chest:   Clear without rales, rhonchi, or wheezes
-Cardiac:   Normal S1 and S2, a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border
-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  No organomegaly
-Extremities:   Peripheral pulses are 1+ and symmetric.  He has no pedal edema.  He has no clubbing or cyanosis

Selected recent labs:

	 Last cholesterol was, 07/06/2077, showed total cholesterol 174, triglycerides 111, HDL 44, and LDL 108.
	


	Other Data:
   The patient underwent exercise tolerance testing in August 2077 and was able to exercise for 6 minutes.  He had no chest pain.  Nuclear images showed no evidence of ischemia or previous infarct.  LV function was normal.
EKG today shows normal sinus rhythm, left axis deviation, right bundle-branch block, and an old IMI.


	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, this is a very pleasant 64-year-old gentleman who had an MI in June 2077, which was a non-ST-elevation MI.  He underwent stenting of his LAD.  Since that time, he has not had any exertional angina.  He has no evidence of fluid retention or decompensated congestive heart failure.  Blood pressure is fine today.  Cholesterol is not perfect, but acceptable.  He is on a high dose of atorvastatin.  He is on a good medical regimen and at this point, I would keep him on his current medicines and plan to see him back in another six months.  He would like to enter a Cardiac Rehab Program and I think that certainly is a reasonable thing to do.

As always, it is a pleasure to be able to participate in the care of this very pleasant gentleman.

Best personal regards,

Sincerely yours,

Patient is here for follow-up.



1. CAD.  Patient admitted to the hospital in middle of November after she presented with pulmonary edema.  Ruled in for an MI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and she underwent three vessel CABG.  Postoperative course relatively smooth although she had been postoperative pneumothorax and had a chest tube which was only needed briefly.  Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.  Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications.  Has not had any further recurrence of these symptoms.



Since her discharge patient has been doing quite well, no complaints of any chest pain, gets a little bit short of breath after exerting herself for a while but this is secondary to lack of conditioning and comes on gradually and results quickly as she rests.  Has more energy, had previously asked for a walk of a core she felt weak and now does not feel the need for this.  Also had had some lower extremity edema and this has now resolved.  Reports compliance with her new medical regimen with no untoward effects.  She was discharged to home without aspirin.  Patient followed by Dr. Nesbitt and has a follow-up appointment with him end of January, also has follow-up appointment with cardiothoracic surgery.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Patient had a gastric ulcer last July, biopsy without any evidence of malignancy and no evidence of H. pylori.  During recent hospitalization had a follow-up EGD which showed no evidence of continued disease.  Patient does report that for the past two nights she has woken up during the night with some stomach discomfort.  This seemed to have been relieved this morning by Prilosec.  Not using any NSAIDs.



Social History: Living with her daughter for the moment in Culpeper Colorado but hoping to move back to her own apartment in Adrian.



Physical Exam



Patient is in no apparent distress.

Weight: 114 pounds

Blood Pressure: 114/56

Assessment and Plan



1.  CAD.  Doing quite well, continue current regimen.  Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain.  Will speak with Dr. Nesbitt regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease.  Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain.  For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose.  If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.



I will see her for follow-up in two months.

Tanner, Yul

MR #099-04-65-0

08/28/86

 

I saw Mr. Tanner today for a routine follow-up visit.  I last

saw him in November of 2085.  In May he presented to the

emergency room with dehydration and hyperglycemia.  Diagnosis of

non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus was made.  He is now on

Glyburide and metformin.  His renal function at that time was

normal with a BUN of 15 and creatinine of 0.90.  His potassium at

that time was 4.6.  Otherwise, he is doing pretty well.  He has

lost about 40 lb.  He has seen a nutritionist regarding dietary

counseling.  

 

Today his weight is 258 lb.  Blood pressure 120/80.  Heart rate

100.  Current medications lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.,

hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 q.d., Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.,

metformin 500 mg t.i.d., diltiazem 180 p.o. q.d.   Urinalysis

shows 3+ blood, 4+ protein.

 

IMPRESSION:  #1)  Thin based membrane disease with persistent

hematuria and proteinuria.  #2)  History of renal ________.  

#3)  Type 2 diabetes.

 

PLAN:  Continue current medications.   Continue high water

intake.  Encourage weight loss and compliance with his diet.  

 

I spent some time talking to him about the importance of weight

loss and controlling his diabetes given his underlying kidney

disease.  Follow-up visit in nine months.

Mr. Tanner RTC to discuss diabetes, BP, weight, lipids.



HPI: He has been overweight for some time, and was found to have DM II about two years ago. I had treated him with:

GLYBURIDE  5MG PO BID

METFORMIN  500MG PO TID

LISINOPRIL  40MG PO QD

DILTIAZEM CD  180MG PO QD

HCTZ  12.5MG PO QD



however he enrolled in a study, and when it was over he was put on:



DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD 

HYZAAR (25 MG/100 MG) (HCTZ 25MG   LOSART... 1 TAB     PO QD 



When I found his A1c to be 8.7%, I added back 5 mg QD of glyburide which he has been taking for < 1 month. He feels well. He says he's lost 10 lbs. since his last visit (262 lbs. on 2/26 - 263 lbs. today) but he's interested in a weight loss program.



MEDICATIONS

DILTIAZEM CD 180 MG     PO QD

Cardiac: RRR, rate   68 , no extra sounds

Resp.: good air movement, no accessory muscle use, no adventitious sounds



Plan:

1. by his account DM control is still poor, which is not surprising since he previously required 10 mg of glyburide and 1500 mg of metformin per day. For now I will increase glyburide to 5 mg BID.

2. also poor BP control for a diabetic. Increasing Diltiazem to 240 mg QD. It's unfortunate that he was taken off lisinopril.

3. MALB has improved but is still high; reports suggest Diltiazem might help with this.

4. discussed necessity for weight loss for DM, BP, lipids.

5. RTC 1 month.

Dear Dr. Truong:



We had the pleasure of caring for your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner, during his admission to the Floyd County Hospital from 12/19/2092 through 12/20/2092 for diagnostic catheterization.  As you recall, he is a 57-year-old man with a history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity, who initially presented with chest discomfort on 12/09/2092.  Mr. Tanner ruled out for myocardial infarction at that time and underwent stress testing, which was positive.  He returns today for diagnostic catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization revealed noncritical coronary artery disease with an approximately 50% ostial right coronary artery lesion in a left dominant system.  The right femoral arteriotomy site was manually compressed without complication.  Mr. Tanner was admitted to the Cardiovascular Unit overnight for observation.  Overnight he did well, specifically, he denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, groin, or flank pain.  He remained hemodynamically stable, and was ambulating, eating, and voiding without difficulty.



On examination, his cardiac exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 and S2.  Lungs were clear to auscultation throughout all lung fields.  His groin was soft and mildly tender with no hematoma and no bruit noted.  His lower extremities were warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses.



His morning labs were significant for sodium of 142, potassium of 4.1, BUN of 18, creatinine of 1.  A CBC revealed a white blood cell count of 4.74, hematocrit of 31.6, and platelets of 304,000.  A fasting lipid panel revealed total cholesterol of 107, triglycerides of 130, HDL of 30, and LDL of 51.



We are planning on discharging Mr. Tanner on the following medications, aspirin 81 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg daily, diltiazem extended release 360 mg daily, Levoxyl 250 mcg daily, lisinopril 40 mg daily, NPH insulin 80 units subcutaneous daily, Avandia 4 mg daily, and metformin 850 mg twice daily to start on 12/21/2092.  We have asked that he follow up with you in the next one to two weeks, and to call with any questions or concerns before then.



Thank you for allowing us to share in the care of your patient, Mr. Yul Tanner.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us regarding his ongoing management.



Sincerely,







Rebecca Eason, MD

Office Visit

 

Re: Larry Lockwood

MPC# 590-33-20-3

 

 

This is a 56 year old morbidly obese male who was discharged recently from 

the 

Marshalltown Pond Clinic who is here for follow up of his newly diagnosed 

diabetes mellitus. He was seen in the emergency room on 10/21 with the 

complaint of urinary frequency, hesitancy, and generally not feeling well. 

Prior to that, he had been treated with antibiotics by his primary care 

physician for a urinary tract infection with Bactrim and then ampicillin but 

he did not get better. He went to the emergency room and was admitted to the 

hospital because his blood sugar was in the 400s and he was diagnosed with 

diabetes at that time. He was discharged on 10/22/78 on insulin NPH 30 units 

in 

the morning and 15 units in the PM and was advised to follow up in the 

outpatient clinic today. Since discharge, his blood sugars have been in the 

200s. This afternoon, it is 242 2 hours after his last meal.

 

Past Medical History: He has a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. He 

sees a urologist and they are discussing a new procedure for the same. He 

cannot have ______ because of his morbid obesity, he cannot be positioned on 

the table for the same. He also gives a history of sleep apnea. No 

hypertension. He does have a history of gastric reflux and obesity.

 

Past Surgical History: He has had bilateral hip surgery for slipped ______ as 

an adolescent.

 

Review of Systems: No chest pain. Positive review of systems for UTI symptoms 

with increased frequency and hesitancy. Other review of systems-he has 

arthritis generalized with more pain in the hip. Also has acid reflux.

 

Family History: Family history of obesity and hypertension but no diabetes or 

coronary artery disease.

 

Social History: He is a smoker but is trying to quit. He smokes less than one 

pack a day. He is a manager and is on disability. He has 2 children and is 

separated.

 

Physical Examination: He is morbidly obese and weighs about 405 pounds. Blood 

pressure 110/88. Pulse 84. Skin exam-there is evidence of acanthosis 

nigricans. He has gynecomastia. Head and neck exam-atraumatic, normocephalic. 

Extraocular movements are intact. Pupils equal, round and reactive to light. 

Cardiovascular system exam-S1, S2 heard. No S3, S4. Respiratory system-clear 

to auscultation and percussion. No added sounds. Abdomen-obese, very 

difficult 

to examine for masses or hepatosplenomegaly. On limited exam, there are no 

masses palpable. CNS-cranial nerves II-XII intact. Examination of feet with 

monofilament is negative as he is not able to feel the monofilament in both 

feet. This impairment is greater on the right foot than left.

 

Labs done so far:  hemoglobin A1c of 14, glucose on 10/21 422, creatinine 1.7, 

BUN 22, sodium 132, potassium 4.5, chloride 97, liver function tests with ALT 

10, AST 10, alkaline phosphatase 126, bilirubin 0.4, total protein 8.1, 

albumin 3.6, globulin 4.5, calcium 9.5, hemoglobin 15.

 

Assessment and Plan: 1. New onset diabetes mellitus. The patient is morbidly 

obese, has features of insulin resistance. His blood sugars today are better 

since admission. He is on insulin twice a day. He checks his blood sugars 3 

times a day and since discharge, they have been around 240 to 300. The 

patient 

is not a good candidate for metformin with his last creatinine of 1.7. He may 

be a candidate for Avandia. At the present time, his alkaline phosphatase is 

mildly elevated but his ALT and AST are normal. He has difficulty coming to 

the clinic and would prefer to have his visiting nurse and nutritionist 

communicate with the clinic physicians to adjust the dose of his insulin and 

also have his blood tests done locally rather than here in the clinic. We 

will 

increase his NPH to 40 units in the morning and 26 units in the PM. We will 

work with the visiting nurse and nutritionist to adjust the insulin dose and 

also order lab tests. We will repeat his hemoglobin A1c in a month and also 

repeat his creatinine and liver function tests at that time to see if he may 

be a candidate for Avandia. I advised the patient to return to the clinic in 

6 

months and also for him to send the blood sugar results every week until his 

blood sugars are under better control.

Dear Dr. Umali:

Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.  Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.  He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.

Review of systems is negative except as above.  Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.

Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.

Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.

Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.  BP 169/83 and pulse 58.  Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  No edema, warm.

Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.  Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.  Skeletal films are pending.

Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..  He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.  I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.  I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.  However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.

In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.  He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.  Thank you for referring this patient.

Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Multiple acute and chronic medical issues,
including subacute weight loss. 

IDENTIFICATION:  This is my first medical visit with this
75-year-old woman with multiple recent hospitalizations.  

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She has a long history of
severe cerebrovascular disease, with multiple strokes.  She
has stenosis in both anterior and posterior circulation. 
Past right carotid endarterectomy.  

In August 2095, she was admitted to BMH with a right
cerebellar stroke, complicated by a brief intubation and
pneumonia.  She underwent stenting of her right vertebral
artery and left common carotid artery.  She had subsequent
episodes of worsening speech, and was started on Coumadin,
with an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.0.  She is followed closely by
Neurology and may, at some point, undergo further
interventional radiology procedures, to be determined.  

During her most recent hospitalization she had some
confusion which was attributed to low sodium.  This was
felt to be the result of osmotic diuresis, and possible
SIADH.  This is being treated with salt tablets, saline
boluses in her G-tube, water restriction, and low-dose
Lasix.  No evidence of adrenal insufficiency.  

Since leaving the hospital, she has had ongoing weight loss.
 Baseline weight 170 pounds.  Weight in early September, 167
pounds.  Weight October 20th, 160 pounds.  Weight <PHI TYPE=""DATE"">November 

28th</PHI>, 141 pounds.  Weight today in clinic 146 pounds on our scale.  

She had a swallowing study on October 26, 2095, which
revealed no aspiration, but very poor bolus formation.  The
G-tube was placed in August, and has healed well, but has
never been used for daily tube feeds on an outpatient basis.
 Over the past couple of weeks, she has worsening trouble
with coughing, choking and sputtering, as she attempts to
swallow.  Her caloric p.o. intake sounds as if it has been
quite minimal, with a couple of ounces of potatoes or pureed
foods here and there.  She is drinking two or three can of
booster Ensure daily, but clearly not meeting her caloric
needs.  Today's visit was with the patient, and her daughter
(phone number 507.741.8042).  

Most recent laboratory studies, done 12/7/2095: Sodium 137,
potassium 4.8, chloride 95, Bicarb 32, BUN 22, creatinine
1.0, calcium 9.9, glucose 162.  

The patient has felt increasingly weak and debilitated, as
her weight has decreased.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Also remarkable for slight bright red
blood per rectum within the last week.  The patient's
daughter describes that she had a normal colonoscopy in
early 2095, at the Richwood Area Community Hospital.  The
patient's daughter will bring me these records at the next
visit. 

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Cerebrovascular disease, as noted above. 
2. Throat cancer in early 2060s.  Status post XRT to the
neck (may have predisposed her to the severe carotid and
vertebral disease).
3. Breast cancer.  Details unknown.  Will review at next
visit. 
4. Diabetes, type II.  On glyburide.  Further details
unknown. 
5. SIADH.  Will review hospital chart in detail. 
6. Hypertension.  Per Neurology, goal blood pressure 140 to
170.  
7. Hypothyroidism.  Details unknown.  Recent TSH normal.  
8. Glaucoma. 
9. Anxiety.  Being followed by Psychiatry on an active
basis.  This was apparently a large factor during her recent
hospitalizations.  
10. Possible recent anemia.  Has not been evaluated thus
far.  

MEDICATIONS:
1. Lisinopril 40 mg p.o. q.d.
2. Synthroid 100 mcg p.o. q.d.
3. Lasix 10 mg p.o. Qa m and Qpm
4. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5. Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. to t.i.d.
6. Enteric-coated baby aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d.
7. Sodium chloride 1 g p.o. Qa m via G-tube
8. Timolol 0.5%, one drop to the right eye q.d. 
9. Prevacid 30 mg p.o. q.d.
10. Normal saline 300 cc via G-tube after breakfast, lunch,
and dinner
11. Multivitamin p.o. q.d.
12. Coumadin, with goal INR 2.5 to 3.0 (followed by Internal Medicine)
13. Xalatan 0.005%, one drop each eye q.h.s.
14. Dulcolax 5 mg p.o. q.d. PRN, constipation
15. Risperdal 0.125 mg to 0.25 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN
16. Ambien 5 mg to 10 mg p.o. q.h.s. PRN
17. Saliva substitute PRN
18. Nystatin, swish-and-swallow PRN
19. Fleet Enema PRN
20. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. PRN

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient has four children.  Her
daughter Fitzpatrick is a Food Service Supervisor.  Another daughter is staying with the
patient full-time.  Visiting nurse is involved.  Previous to
the last few months, the patient was fairly independent. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  
GENERAL:  Cachectic, anxious woman, who is slightly unsteady
on her feet, but safe with ambulation if she moves slowly
and carefully.  Has a cane, but does not always use it.  
VITAL SIGNS:  BP 214/108, initially (patient very anxious),
and 171/74 on repeat.  Pulse 80.  Weight 146.5 pounds, fully
clothed.  
ABDOMEN:  With good bowel sounds.  Soft, nontender and
nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.  No masses.  G-tube is
flushed with water, and flushes easily.  G-tube site itself
is well-healed and nontender, with no pussy discharge.  
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation.  
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs.  

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 
1. Weight loss.  Probably due to poor caloric intake.  This
is a significant health concern for her, as she has become
progressively cachectic and weak.  This is probably
attributed to, by some extent, her progressive dysphagia. 
She is referred urgently to Nutrition, and will see them on
Tuesday.  I suggested to the daughter and to the nutritionist
that we transition her to tube feeds for at least a couple
of weeks, to get her muscle mass up, and then reevaluate. 
She should continue to take p.o. foods as tolerated, but she
needs to attempt to meet her caloric intake via the G-tube,
since she is clearly not meeting it p.o.  Will try Glucerna
because of her diabetes history.  The patient's daughter and
the nutritionist are aware of her issues with vitamin K and
Coumadin, and they will discuss this further when she sees
Nutrition Clinic in two days.  
2. Cerebrovascular disease.  Followed closely by Neurology. 
No acute change in neuro status today.  Will continue
Coumadin.  Being followed closely by Internal Medicine for
this.  Recent INR 1.4.  Will adjust Coumadin as advised by
IM nurse.  
3. SIADH.  I need to review these records more closely, and
try to make sure there is no other underlying disorder.  In
the meantime, her sodiums have been quite good recently. 
4. Diabetes.  Recent hyperglycemia, with sugars in the 300
to 350 range.  Most recently, with sugars in the 100 to 200
range over the past few days.  Continue glyburide 5 mg p.o.
b.i.d.  Finger-sticks three to four times daily.  Further
adjustments PRN.  Our current goal is simply to maintain her
sugars between 120 and approximately 220 to 250.  Once her
dietary issues are stabilized, we can aim for slightly
tighter control.  Wish to avoid hypoglycemia, given her
troubles with p.o. intake.    
5. Recent history of bright red blood per rectum.  Daughter
will bring me her recent colonoscopy report, and we will
take it from there. 
6. Constipation.  Continue Colace.  Add Dulcolax PRN. 
Continue Fleet Enema PRN by visiting nurse.  If she does
have chronic constipation, this may impact her appetite and
her ability to eat successfully.  
7. Hypertension.  Currently in reasonable control.  Goal BP
140 to 170, systolic.  Initial severe hypertension this
visit, attributed to anxiety, which clearly is a major issue
for her.  Follow-up at next visit. 
8. Anxiety.  Followed by Psychiatry.  Extensive reassurance
given today to the patient.  She is very concerned about her
weight loss, as am I.  I tried to reassure her that we would
take this seriously and address it in a very rapid fashion. 

Addendum - spoke with psych - they will start paxil 5 mg qd

watch for worsening SIADH and/or anthicholinergic side effects.
9. Multiple other issues.  To be addressed at further
visits.  Given her weight loss and complexity, I will see
her on a weekly basis for the next few weeks, or sooner PRN.
 Daughter has my pager number, and knows how to reach me.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Hypertension, proteinuria, status post fall,
reevaluate Coumadin.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Urgent care visit for this
77-year-old woman with the history of diabetes, multiple strokes,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and multiple other issues.  Last
week she was at Saint Joseph Memorial Hospital for an eye evaluation.
 It was a very very windy day.  Afterwards she was outside and a
huge gust of wind knocked her over.  Her daughter Fitzpatrick was with
her and Fitzpatrick herself actually had to hold on to something when
the wind blew.  There is no chest pain or presyncope, and no loss
of consciousness either before, during, or after the episode. 
She struck her left trochanteric area, left deltoid area, and
left eyebrow.  She was taken to EFH where she had a normal head
CT.  A single stitch was placed in the laceration along the
lateral edge of her left eyebrow.  She had films of her wrist and
hips both of which were fine.  She has bruising in these areas. 
Other than some pain where the bruising is she feels entirely
back to normal.

She had marked hypertension up to 250.  She was treated with
hydralazine in the ER, and was noted to have proteinuria with
some hematuria.  Her blood pressure at home since then has been
180 and 210 systolic on her usual 40 mg daily of lisinopril.  She
is not on a beta-blocker currently.  She has not had any episodes
of chest pain.  She does feel slightly more woozy than usual.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid 30 mg p.o.
q.d., atorvastatin 10 mg q.d., sertraline 50 mg q.d., warfarin,
lisinopril 40 mg q.d., Ambien 10 mg q.h.s. p.r.n., levothyroxine
100 mg p.o. q.d., aspirin, eyedrops, Colace, and Dulcolax.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is looking forward to a good Christmas. 
She is here today with her daughter Fitzpatrick.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 74, BP 208/66,
weight 148 pounds.
GENERAL: Well appearing woman.
HEENT: PERRL.  Single stitch along the lateral aspect of her left
eyebrow is easily removed.  No evidence of any infection.  Her
left deltoid area is fine and she has good range of motion in the
shoulder.  Her left ribcage is slightly tender but without any
bony step-offs.  She walks well with no pain in her left hip. 
There is a hand sized deep purple bruise over the trochanteric
bursa.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mechanical fall with laceration and
bruising but no more serious complications.  Fortunately she did
not have intracranial bleeding.  I am not sure why her blood
pressure is up, whether this is related to the stress of the
falls verses independent causes.  Given that the high blood
pressure has persisted, I will add atenolol 12.5 mg p.o. q.d.,
and discuss via phone or E-mail with her daughter next week to
see how well this is working.  Goal BP 140-160 systolic.  Her
urine was checked today.  Hematuria has resolved.  She has 2+
proteinuria.  I will recheck this in a week or two after we treat
her hypertension.

We spent over half of today's 45-minute visit discussing risks
and benefits of Coumadin therapy.  Although she is at risk for
falls, she feels quite clearly that she prefers to be on the
Coumadin due to her fear of having a repeated thrombotic stroke. 
She feels that she has not had any bleeding complications, and
that she really would not like to suffer through another stroke. 
I explained that there was some risk with falls of intracranial
hemorrhage and its consequences.  I spoke with Dr. Dewitt last
month about her Coumadin, and we both feel that it seems to be
working well in terms of stroke prevention, but that she is at
increased risk for falls.  It seems to me that she is in a gray
area with no clear right answer in terms of risk benefit analysis
for Coumadin for her.  She feels very strongly that she wishes to
continue.  This was discussed in detail with her and her
daughter, and this probably is a reasonable decision.  I
encouraged her to restart physical therapy to work on her
strength and hopefully diminish her risk of a subsequent fall. 
More than half of today's 45-minute visit spent in patient
counseling and education.

Record date: 2098-06-13

Betty has been doing ""okay"" since our last visit; she continues to report a slow decline in swallowing ability.  She had a video swallow at SJMH; she and Fitzpatrick were told that the underlying problem was local changes due to her radiation.  Her gait has been unchanged, but she still feels it has deteriorated a little over the last year.



She is gardening, and trying to stay active; she has had no falls and uses a cane.



She recently added amlodipine for her hypertension.





Echocardiogram:

Date: 9/02/95: borderline LVH, preserved EF.  Posterobasal HK.  Not done for PFO.



Brain & Vessel Studies:

MRI/A:

CTA:

3/20/98: ""severe proximal LICA stenosis"", just distal to bifurcation...no comment on comparison.

9/29/95:  >90% RCCA, unchanged from the exam of 9/04/95.  >90% LCCA proximal to the stent with elevated flow velocities within the stent.  70-75% LICA.  The estimation of stenosis in the left internal carotid artery may be low because of tandem stenoses in the left carotid artery.  Compared to the study of 9/04/95, the LICA lesion is modestly worse. >50% in B ECAs.

9/26/95: Lbif stenosis >= 50%.  Rbif without significant stenosis.  RVA dominant.

  	  	  	  	  	  	Ultrasound:

8/24/95: Low RCCA 50-75%, Mid LCCA 75-90%, calcified LICA possibly >50%

  	  	  	  	  	  	Angiography:

8/27/95: proximal RCCA stenosis >80%, ACA cross-filling from L-->R.  Right vertebral irregular/stenotic.  LCCA, bifurcation, LICA with significant tandem stenoses; at the proximal mid-LCCA, >80%.

  	  	

Functional Cerebrovascular Studies:

Diamox SPECT 7/14/97: interpreted as normal.

  	  	

Vascular Procedures:

Right CEA (years ago)

8/31/95: (1) right vertebral origin balloon angioplasty, successful.  (2) LCCA stent followed by balloon angioplasty.  (3) although wanted to stent LICA, exceeded fluoro time.

Blood pressure in the left arm is 174/60.

She appears well overall, but slightly anxious.  Cognitively, she appears unchanged; her speech is fluent, with intact repetition and comprehension, and her recall of recent events (corroborated by her daughter) is good.



Pupils are equal and reactive, EOMI, VFFTC.  Face, tongue and palate are symmetric, but she is dysarthric; glottal sounds worst.  This sounds slightly worse than our previous visit.  Strength is full in all extremities; her mild dysmetria is unchanged.  Her walk, always wide-based and slightly unsteady, appears mildly worse than our previous visit, but she is not using a cane, and is able to catch herself after mild stumbles.  She is unable to tandem gait.



Impression:

Betty is a 78 year old woman with progressive cerebrovascular disease due to local radiation, plus diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia.  She is s/p left ICA stents and right VA angioplasty.  Her most significant vascular lesion is stenosis proximal to the ICA stent, but there is no hint now of transient or orthostatic symptoms.



My continued feeling is that we ought to focus on her controllable risk factors, such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, as you are doing.  I understand you have recently been adjusting her antihypertensive regimen.  I would recommend a goal systolic blood pressure no lower than 120 mmHg.



I think a reasonable way to approach this is to use (1) her clinical status, and (2) 'functional' imaging, such as Diamox SPECT, to follow her cerebrovascular disease.  I think intervention would be warranted if there were a deterioration in one of these parameters.



I have not yet heard from Howard Yelverton about his thoughts regarding the recent scan, but I did review the CT scans with neuroradiology.  Our impression is that, while the wording of the reports seems to suggest significant progression of the LICA stenosis, it's not significant enough to prompt us to act, in the absence of symptomatic or functional changes.



I am ordering a Diamox SPECT scan, since the previous one was in July of last year.



This is my last general neurology clinic at BMH; I will be a neuromuscular fellow here next year.  While I can be available for questions or concerns, I will be referring Betty's care to one of the more junior residents.

history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, depression, H 
pylori, gastric reflux with increasing back pain and epigastric 
pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  She says over the last couple of 
days it is unrelieved with food but not exacerbated by food.  She 
occasionally has a pressure in her epigastrium, no radiation to her 
neck, chest, no shortness of breath, no palpitations, no 
diaphoresis, no vomiting, no hematochezia, or melena but she has 
had increased frequency of her BM to three or four a day.  No 
dysuria or urgency.  She describes the pain as constant. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, GERD. 
MEDICATIONS:  Tetracycline, Prilosec, Ativan, atenolol, Zestril. 
ALLERGIES:  Aspirin which causes upset stomach. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Nonsmoker. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 98.1, pulse 92, respiratory rate 
16, blood pressure 196/84.  Skin:  Warm and dry.  She is 
well-developed, well-nourished female in no distress.  Pupils are 
equal, round, reactive light.  Extraocular movements are full. 
Sinuses nontender.  Oropharynx clear.  Nasopharynx clear.  Neck: 
Supple, full range of motion.  There is no JVD.  Heart:  Regular 
rate and rhythm without murmur.  Abdomen is soft.  Lungs are clear. 
Extremities:  There is no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Rectal 
exam is nontender with brown, trace guaiac positive stool. 
Neurologic exam is nonfocal.

hemoglobin of 14, platelet count of 259.  Electrolytes are normal. 
Amylase and lipase are 71 and 204 respectively.  H pylori IgA is 
positive from previous studies.  CK is 72, troponin is 0.  Chest 
x-ray is reviewed with Radiologist and is normal.  EKG shows normal 
sinus rhythm with some T wave flattening in the inferior lateral 
leads. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  Patient was seen, given aspirin, 
Lopressor, and nitroglycerin.  If her pain doesn't resolve with and 
a GI cocktail she will be admitted to the Observation Unit.  Because 
 of the concern that her pain goes to her back, she has a CT scan 
to rule out aortic dissection which is reviewed with the 
Radiologist and is negative. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Atypical chest pain, perhaps consistent with 
angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Condition at 
this time is stable.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with past medical history notable for hypertension and dyslipidemia, but no coronary artery disease who presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and lightheadedness.  The history is obtained in Spanish from the patient and through her daughter who assisted with translation.  In general, she has apparently been doing well with no episodes of chest discomfort or exertional dyspnea until roughly three days ago when she has began to notice episodic problems with walking even short distances before she feels as though she might pass out.  The episodes have occurred multiple times per day and after a particularly severe episode this morning, she brought her mother to the emergency department for evaluation.  There have been no syncopal episodes and no complaints of palpitations, orthopnea, PND, or lower extremity edema.  The patient has not had symptoms like this before and has been chronically treated with atenolol for hypertension for many years.


Her only cardiovascular evaluation has been with adenosine MIBI in 2085, which revealed normal systolic function and no evidence for ischemia.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Notable for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastritis, and osteoarthritis.  She also carries the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but is not currently treated for this.


MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Included amitriptyline 25 mg at bedtime, aspirin 81 mg daily, atenolol 25 mg daily, Lipitor 10 mg at bedtime, hydrochlorothiazide/lisinopril 25/20 one tablet daily, loratadine 10 mg daily, and Protonix 40 mg daily.


She developed gastrointestinal irritation with higher doses of aspirin.


SOCIAL AND FAMILY HISTORY:  As noted in the housestaff notes.


PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the Emergency Department, her heart rate is 38 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg.  Her venous pressures are low and there are BLANK waves present every other beat.  The chest is clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam reveals bradycardia with normal S1, wide physiologically split S2, and an audible S4.  There is no murmur.  The abdomen is soft and nontender.  The liver is not palpably enlarged.  The extremities are warm without edema.


Electrocardiogram reveals sinus rhythm with 2:1 AV block and right bundle-branch block.  There is left axis deviation consistent with left anterior fascicular block.


There is no response of her heart rate to mild calisthenics in the bed.


Laboratories are notable for normal BUN to creatinine ratio of 23/1.2 with a potassium of 4.1 and a hematocrit of 35%.  Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative.


In summary, Karson Uhrich is a 73-year-old woman with hypertension and dyslipidemia who presents with a three-day history of presyncope and weakness in the context of a new diagnosis of 2:1 AV block.  Review of previous electrocardiograms reveals no right bundle-branch block and left anterior fascicular block and of late this represents progression of her underlying conduction system disease.  We will proceed to permanent temporary pacemaker implantation for backup support and will arrange electrophysiologic consultation for permanent pacemaker implantation.  There is no history to suggest an ischemic syndrome, so I did not think additional pharmacologic stress test is necessary.  Her beta-blocker will be held overnight in addition to her amitriptyline to see if this facilitates recovery of her AV nodal function.  Overall, I think this likely represents infra-hisian block and a pacemaker should be curative therapy.  Additional plans will be dictated by her clinical course.

Patient Name: LE, WILLIAM;  MRN: 0540099
Dictated on: 08/09/2161 by WILSON RUCKER, M.D. 

 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  The patient presents for evaluation of chronic neck and left arm pain.  
 
HPI:  This is a 71-year-old right-handed gentleman with past medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes, coronary artery disease, status post bypass surgery, hypertension, and bladder cancer, who presents with worsening neck and left arm pain, which is now interfering with his daily life.  The patient has had a chronic arthritic pain throughout his body, which he has been complaining of for approximately 10 years involving his 
neck, shoulder, arms, knees, and back.  More recently in the past months to couple of years, his neck, left arm, and shoulder pain have been his predominant pain symptoms.  It has been a gradual onset.  He has had similar problems in the past.  He reports that his pain is intermittent and occurs daily.  He states the pain is burning, cramping, pins and needle, sharp, numb, shooting pain, dull achy, electric- like, throbbing, and pressure-like.  The pain involves numbness to his hands and fingers on his left arm.  His pain ranges from 10/10 at worst to 0/10 at best.  It is worse in almost all active positions including lying down, standing, sitting, walking, and driving.  Medications do not seem to help.  Relaxation and rest decreases the pain.  It is also worsened by lifting or bending his neck.  He tried physical therapy approximately 10 days ago at Manamana with minimal to no relief.  The patient has had injections to his cervical spine in the past, he has had shoulder injections, which helped in the past.  He had MRI performed of his 
cervical spine on March 21, 2161, which documented moderate- to-severe degenerative changes throughout his cervical spine with significant right neuroforaminal narrowing at multiple levels.  There is narrowing of the left neural foramen at 
C5-6.  
 
PAST MEDICATIONS:  The patient is not clear what pain medicines he has taken in the past.  
 
Current medications include Nexium, Colace, atenolol, aspirin, Neurontin 200 mg two times a day, insulin, Pravachol, glucosamine chondroitin, vitamin E, Lasix, and potassium chloride.  
 
He has allergies to penicillin, Vioxx, and Lipitor.   
Past medical history is significant for high blood pressure, heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, 
hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and bladder cancer.  
 
SURGICAL HISTORY:  He denies any spine surgery.  He has had two prior arthroscopic knee surgeries.  He had twice left shoulder surgery; he is not clear what this was.  He has had a TURP.  
 
PSYCHOSOCIAL HISTORY:  He has high school eduction.  He is not currently engaged in regular exercise program.  His pain does limit his daily activities, especially bending over and also affects his recreational activities including regular yard work and lifting.  He also has lifting restrictions from orthopedic physician as well as yard work restrictions from his cardiac physician.  He is a retired wholesale specialist.  He worked for over 30 years in sales 
business.  He is not currently working.  He is married and lives in Dickinson, Maryland.  He denies any history of alcoholism, detox program or current tobacco use.  He denies any history of psychologic evaluation or treatments including _____ and no history of abuse.   
He has family history heart disease and diabetes.  
 
Review of systems is negative for any unexplained weight loss, fevers, chills, recent infections, bleeding, positive bowel or bladder incontinence, numbness in the genital area.  He does report some numbness and tingling in his arms as well as legs as reported above and some generalized weakness of his muscles, particularly with his left upper extremity muscles throughout.  He denies any problems with sleep.   
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a well-appearing gentleman appearing his stated age, slight obese, well nourished, well groomed.  Psychiatric:  Normal attention and concentration, normal mood and affect.  Eyes:  Conjunctivae anicteric, no ptosis.  Skin:  No rashes or lesions.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs:  No intercostal retractions 
or accessory muscle use.  Musculoskeletal:  Spine 
inspection, no significant kyphoscoliosis.  Cervical range of motion is limited throughout.  Flexion 20 degrees, extension 10 degrees, rotation is 20 degrees, right and left.  The patient is unable to side bend significantly. Reflexes are 2+, bilateral biceps, triceps, brachioradialis. Manual muscle testing is 5/5, bilateral upper extremities 
with the exception of wrist extension, shoulder abduction, and shoulder flexion and extension, and internal, external rotation.  Muscle tone is normal with the exception of asymmetry in the left hand interossei.  Sensory testing is impaired to pinprick, throughout bilateral upper extremities to the elbows.  Intact grossly to light touch per the patient's report.  Gait is steady with a cane.  The patient has signs of limited range of motion in the left shoulder, status post multiple surgeries and limited range of motion in all directions.  He has some palpation tenderness of the cervical spine, in C5-6 and C4-5 paravertebral areas on the left.   
Medical decision making involved review of the patient's radiology reports and radiology films.  
 
IMPRESSION:  The patient has a significant degenerative disease of his cervical spine.  In addition, he has multiple levels of neural foraminal narrowing and herniation in the cervical spine.  In addition to this, he has symptoms consistent with diabetic peripheral neuropathy with also prior traumatic injury to his shoulder with possible brachial plexopathy.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:  
1.  Given the multiple etiologies possible for his symptoms in his left arm, which are his predominant symptoms:  Brachial plexopathy versus peripheral neuropathy versus cervical radiculopathy, we have referred the patient for an EMG to delineate the cause of his symptoms.  
2.  He will return to clinic after his EMG and from that point, we will decide the course of action for pain management.  At this time, he will continue on the Neurontin 200 mg two times a day.  We will review his medications on next visit.  We provided the patient also with education in regards to his problems and the treatment options.

RE:  William Le

MRN:  054-00-99

DOB:  09/03/2089



DOS:  02/25/2163



Dear Dr Chavez,



Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.  He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home. He has not sustained any significant injuries.  He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.



Medications:  Neurontin 300mg TID, Lasix 40mg daily, aspirin, Atenolol 50mg daily, Zetia 10mg, Pravastatin 20mg, Nexium and multi vitamins.



Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.  He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.  Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.  Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet. Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.



Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.  This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162. This most likely is a MGUS.



Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.  The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.  Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.  He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.  I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control. Follow-up in 6 months





Sincerely,







Charles Tisdale

			Reason for visit:

   Follow up of CAD s/p CABG adn multiple CV risk factors



			Interval History:

   A 74 yo man with a long history of CAD eventually necessitating CABG in 4/2161.  He has had several chest pain syndromes over the years but, as of late, has been doing quite well in that regard.

His last CV evaluation was an Adenosine PET in 4/63 which showed an EF 46 with anterior and anterolateral flow abnormalites.  These are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).  His last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his OM and to his RCA and a patent but atretic LIMA.  He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).  

He was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.  His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.  He does have a long-standing trifasicular block.

He denies any chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LEE, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.

Someone started him on Niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.

			Assessment and plan:

   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.  His chest pain syndromes have resolved.  He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.  This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.

CV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.

Plan.

1. CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.  He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).

2. LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.

3. DM-followed by Dr. Orton.  Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0

4. Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.  Continue to Rx risk factors.

5. Lipids-look great today.  Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon!  We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.

6. HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg.  I am trying to get him on an ARB again.  Diovan at 80 a day. He will get f/u labs in one month

RE:  Shilpa Pickett
     MR #129-53-47-3
 
Dear Philip:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing Shilpa Pickett in Cardiovascular
Clinic today.  Since her discharge from the hospital in September,
she has noticed that she is fatigue with exertion but has had no
chest pressure and no exertional diaphoresis, nausea, or jaw pain. 
She does note occasional lightheadedness throughout the day, this
is not related to position or going from sitting to standing
position.  As you are aware, her MIBI test showed very small amount
of ischemia almost undetectable in amount.  
 
Her medical regimen includes Lasix 40 mg po q.d., Lisinopril 20 mg
po q.d., 125 mg of hydrochlorothiazide b.i.d.  Of note, she was
taking an additional Lisinopril at 20 mg po b.i.d.  Labetalol 200
mg b.i.d., Isordil 40 t.i.d., Prilosec 20 mg po q.d., Cisapride 10
mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po q.d., aspirin 325 mg po q.d.
 
On physical exam, her blood pressure is 140/90 right and left arm
seated, heart rate is 77 and irregular, respiratory rate is 12. 
There is no increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are free
of bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout.  Cardiac
exam is notable for distant heart sounds with no S3, S4.  Abdomen
is soft and nontender.  The extremities are free of edema.  
 
Electrocardiogram is normal sinus rhythm with left bundle branch
block unchanged from prior electrocardiograms.
 
In summary, Shilpa Pickett certainly has cardiovascular risk
factors of sedentary lifestyle, diabetes, high cholesterol and
increase in weight.  We will be rechecking her lipid profile today. 
She reports to me that she has absolutely no appetite for the foods
she usually eats and has occasionally had trouble eating.  She
notes no dysphoria and no other signs or symptoms of depression. 
She has had no change in her hair or skin.  For the

moment, I will be reviewing her SMA 20 for evidence of liver
dysfunction but would strongly consider both depression and
hyperthyroidism for further workup of this loss of appetite.  
 
It is certainly a pleasure for me to participate in Shilpa
Pickett' care.  Let me know if there are any questions or issues I
can be of help with.
 
Sincerely,

PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Syncope. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Seventy-year-old female with 
diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease complaining about 
syncopal episode today.  The patient states that over the last 
couple of weeks she has had increased chest palpitations and two 
weeks ago was given an event monitor which he has intermittently 
worn saying it is difficult to wear during the heat wave.  This 
a.m. the patient had a syncopal episode while watching a 
disagreement between her two grandchildren.  The patient states had 
no chest pain, dizziness, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient fell to 
the floor and awoke, denies incontinence or tongue biting. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery 
disease, CVA. 
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin, Lasix, Lopressor, Isordil, insulin, 
lisinopril, Colace, nitroglycerin sublingual, Cisapride, Prilosec. 
ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Well developed, well nourished female with a 
Glasgow Coma Scale of 15.  HEENT normocephalic, atraumatic.  Neck 
supple without spinal tenderness.  Heart regular rate and rhythm, 
positive 2/6 systolic ejection murmur.  Chest is clear.  Abdomen is 
soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Extremities without 
clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neuro alert and oriented times three, 
good motor strength throughout, sensory intact, no focality. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Syncopal episode most likely cardiac in origin. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Will admit to 
monitor and rule out for MI.  The patient was admitted in stable 
condition.

EASLEY BAPTIST HOSPITAL                         Pickett, Silpa 
                                              12953473
                                              03-20-63 
 
 
 
CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Pickett comes to the Easley Baptist Hospital with 
numerous complaints.  
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She states that she has not been feeling well 
since her upper respiratory tract infection.  She had the flu in January 
and then developed another upper respiratory tract infection a couple of 
weeks ago.  She states that this has severely debilitated her.  She is 
complaining of occasional nonproductive cough, post nasal drip, and 
occasional dull headache.  However, her main concern is her stomach and 
her back.  Ms. Pickett continues to have postprandial nausea and discomfort 
in her epigastrium, particularly after eating.  This is different than her 
reflux disease, which she feels is under fairly good control, with the 
Prilosec-Propulsid combination.  She is describing some anorexia, although 
she has not lost any weight.  She has not had any alterations in her bowel 
movements.  She has not been constipated or had diarrhea.  She wonders 
whether this could be in gallbladder.  In addition, she is continuing to 
have some back pain with radiation down her left leg in the L5/S1 
distribution.  She had one epidural steroid injection but was due to go 
back.  Given her upper respiratory tract infection, this was postponed.  
 
She is not having any heart symptoms or shortness of breath.  Her sugars 
have been under good control, ranging between 111 and 143.  Her blood 
pressure is 152/70 today, with a pulse of 70.  She is saturating well.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical exam, lungs were clear to auscultation.  
There was no JVD.  Heart: regular rate and rhythm with positive S4, ? S3 
with no significant murmur.  Abdomen was soft, nondistended, with some 
mild tenderness without rebound or guarding over the right upper quadrant.  
Abdomen was somewhat bloated per patient and diffusely tender.  
Extremities revealed some mild pedal edema left greater than right.  
 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  A seventy-one-year-old woman with multiple medical 
issues, including coronary artery disease, CHF, diabetes, hypertension, 
and cerebrovascular disease.  She came in today for discussion of her 
ongoing lumbar radiculopathic pain as well as her abdominal complaint.
 
With regard to her back pain, she wanted a prescription for Tylenol with 
codeine, which has helped in the past.  I gave her a prescription.  I 
warned her about the possible side effects of constipation.  She should 
contact the pain clinic as soon as she feels able, for a repeat epidural 
steroid injection.
 
With regard to her abdominal complaints, the bubbling in her chest, 
postprandial nausea and anorexia could certainly be due to gallbladder 
disease.  Unclear contribution from her reflux.  Dr. Mario Robison 
recommended elective cholecystectomy.  Given the fact that Ms. Pickett is 
being more and more bothered by these symptoms, it may be reasonable to 
EASLEY BAPTIST HOSPITAL                         Pickett, Silpa

                                              03-20-63

consider her for the surgery.  I have asked her to call Dr. Xiques and 
make an appointment to discuss her cardiovascular risk so that she can 
make an informed decision about the surgery.  
 
She is otherwise up to date with her issues and doing relatively well from 
a cardiovascular and diabetic perspective.  She would probably do better 
with lower blood pressure.  We could consider increasing her Imdur.  
 
I plan to follow up with her in a few weeks time.

The patient was seen with Dr. Mueller.  I confirmed her history and

physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient.  Please

see her note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 77-year-old female with a

several-week history of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, which

has worsened over the past 3 days, per the patient and her son. 

These episodes are ""gassy feeling"" in the epigastrium associated

with nausea and vomiting and lightheadedness.  No chest pain, no

shortness of breath.  Of note, the patient has a history of

coronary artery disease with atypical symptoms.  She has also had

a history of pancreatitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake and alert, in no distress at

this time.  Afebrile with a pulse of 62, blood pressure 140/60,

and O2 sat 100% on room air.  Neck is supple with no signs of

meningismus.  Head is atraumatic.  Moist mucous membranes.  Lungs

are clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Heart has regular rate

and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft with mild epigastric tenderness to

palpation.  No guarding or rebound on my exam.  Extremities are

warm and well perfused.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient's IV access was

established.  Labs were drawn revealing white count of 8,

hematocrit of 39.  BUN and creatinine of 36 and 1.5, which is

normal for the patient.  LFTs are normal.  Lipase is slightly

elevated at 67.  Troponin less than assay.  Urinalysis 25-30

white cells.  The patient's EKG was left bundle-branch block,

which is unchanged.  KUB shows no air fluid levels.  This patient

has a possible mild pancreatitis as well as a mild urinary tract

infection.  In addition, she has multiple cardiac risk factors

and an EKG, which will not allow for conventional cardiac stress

testing.

She will be admitted the hospital for enzymatic rule out MI with

a possible necessity to have a stress MIBI as well as to give IV

antibiotics for urinary tract infection and hydration and serial

exams for her probable pancreatitis.  The patient was admitted to

the floor in stable condition.

Ms. Stevens is a 64 year old lady with ESRD admitted with hypertension and nausea as well as vomiting. She was quite hypertensive and I would wonder about the effect of BP. She also looks fluid overloaded.


PLAN:


HD x 3 1/4 hours, 2 K, 2.5 Ca
Negative 3 liters
Needs Medication clarification and good BP control.

IMPRESSION - 

1. ESRD
 - HD today 3 hrs (12/97 was undergoing 2.5 hr HD runs, but 9/97 was undergoing 3 hr runs; will measure URR and Kt/V), 2K/2.5Ca, 3L UF, no EPO, zemplar 1 mcg.  No heparin with HD given possible GI bleed.


2. ACCESS &#8211; During 8/97 admission, was to undergo fistulogram but per notes from last 9/97 admission AVF was functioning well.  Good thrill/bruit on exam. Place sign over bed indicating no BP's/IV's/blood draws from LUE.


3. ANEMIA &#8211; 
Hb currently high, but per ER notes had bloody stool overnight (per signout from current ER nurse and resident, no recurrence of hematochezia), has not had sufficient time to equilibrate.  Will hold EPO for now, would consider serial CBC's.  Consider GI consult given hematochezia, sigmoid c/rectal thickening on CT; distribution of colon involvement not in watershed area, but given extensive atherosclerotic disease, ischemic colitis possible in addition to infectious etiologies.

Phos at goal, on phoslo 1 tab po tidac.  PTH below goal, will give low dose zemplar 1 mcg IV.  VIt 25oh D low 8/27/97, may have already received course of ergo, will repeat levels and if &lt; 30, will need addtl course ergocalciferol.


5. VOLUME/HTN &#8211; 
Pt with elevated BP, volume up on exam; CT study also demonstrates pleural effusions, mild ascites, and diffuse soft tissue edema.  Pre-HD wt not obtained, will aim for 3L UF (EDW 48 kg).


6. NUTRITION &#8211; 
1.5L fluid restrict, 2g K restrict, continue nephrocaps.  Continue labetalol and lisinopril.


7. HEMATOCHEZIA - See #3.


8. LUNG OPACITY - Received vanc and cefepime for possible pna in ER prior to arrival on HD. Vanc not given on HD.  Would give addtl dose of cefepime 1 g today after HD.  Blood cx's x 2 drawn on HD.


Pt to be discussed with Dr. Ingle.

CC: hypotension  



HPI: 



65 y/o F with colon cancer (known, surgery/GI refuse to proceduralize), ESRD on HD (M/W/F), CVA c/b severe residual speech/cognitive deficits, HTN, recurrent GIB who presents with hypotension. She was en route to her normal dialysis session, and EMT took BP that was 80s/40s, brought to LCH ED for evaluation. Notably recently admitted to Santa Rosa on 9/10/2098 for hematemesis/hematochezia, but no intervention done. No report of recent GI bleeding. 



In ED, initial BP in 80s/30s, got 1.5 liters of IV fluid, came up to 90s/50s. Also was on 4-5 liters of oxygen with sat 95%. Blood and urine cultures sent, Vancomycin and Cefepime given. Daughter was contacted, who states patient is definitely DNR/DNI and no invasive interventions are to be done (including central lines, surgery, etc.) Bedside ultrasounds revealed known pleural effusions, pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade, and hypoechoic material in bladder suspicious for abscess/infection. CT abdomen done, was notable for bladder wall thickening potentially c/w cystitis, a new moderate sized pericardial effusion, and rectal wall thickening c/w proctitis. After CT, Foley placed with reported return of 400-500 cc of frank pus. Labs notable for K 5.0, BUN/Cr 39/4.02, WBC count 7.7. 



Patient seen in ED &#8211; BP 80s/40s, but arousable and able to answer simple questions. Denies any complaints, including pain, dyspnea, nausea, with one-word answers.



When daughter subsequently arrives, she confirms desire for no invasive procedures, lines, surgeries, or ICU level care. She does add that patient was at Levi Hospital two weeks ago, treated for &#8220;lung infection.&#8221; Uncertain of specifics.

RADIOLOGY

Abdominal CT IMPRESSION: 

     1.  New moderate-sized pericardial effusion with pericardial 

     enhancement which may be due to pericarditis or pericardial 

     metastatic disease.

     2. Rectal wall thickening with fecal impaction, consistent with 

     proctitis, possibly due to venous stasis.

     3. Thickened urinary bladder wall with irregularity and enhancement 

     consistent with cystitis.

     4. Slight increase in moderate ascites since 4/2/98.

     5. Distended urinary bladder with unchanged bladder wall thickening.



Also noted are moderate bilateral pleural effusions.

AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT                                                       

Multiple aortic leaflets are thickened but there is no stenosis.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is evidence of mild aortic insufficiency by color

and spectral Doppler.  The aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is 29 mm

(normal: less than 40mm).  The ascending aorta diameter above the sinotubular

junction is 28 mm (normal: less than or equal to 36mm).

                                                                                

LEFT VENTRICLE                                                                  

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is within normal limits.  There is symmetric left ventricular

hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  The

estimated ejection fraction is 66 %.  LVEF was measured by the single dimension

method.

                                                                                

TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC                                                      

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. 

The inferior vena cava is dilated. There is no phasic collapse of the IVC noted.

                                                                                

PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.                                                  

There is evidence of mild pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral

Doppler.  The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid

velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg).  The estimated RV systolic

pressure is 41 mmHg.                                                        

RIGHT VENTRICLE                                                                 

The right ventricle is not dilated.  There is right ventricular hypertrophy. 

The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.                                                                  

INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM                                     

There is no evidence of a patent foramen ovale by Doppler.                                                                                

PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES                                     

There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.  There is no

echocardiographic evidence of tamponade.  There are intrapericardial fibrinous

strands.  There is evidence of a large pleural effusion.  There is ascites.                                                                       

CONCLUSIONS                                                                     

Compared to the study of 3/18/98, a small circumferential pericardial effusion

is now noted, and the measured RVSP has decreased (55 mm Hg previously). LVH

and RVH have appeared.



EKG: 

EKG reviewed &#8211; notable for low voltages, normal intervals, no significant ST changes compared to prior



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN



65F with colon cancer (but not candidate for intervention), CVA with residual speech/cognitive deficits, recurrent GI bleeds, HTN, p/w hypotension. Suspect likely UTI as source given frank pyuria. Can&#8217;t rule out SBP in setting of ascites and abdominal pain, but seems less likely. Does have bilateral pleural effusions, but these are chronic and without other signs of empyema, and small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade. Goals of care are decidedly conservative. 



Shock, likely 2/2 urosepsis: Foley placed, purulent material returned. Culture pending. Got Vanc 1 gm in ED at approximately noon, 2 gm cefepime at noon.

-continue cefepime 1 gm daily

-vanc 1 gm with HD

-consider diagnostic paracentesis tonight (daughter said this procedure seems reasonable), but would be of limited value given diagnostic only and more likely source of UTI

-with finding of proctitis on CT, will add IV flagyl 



Hypoxia, bilateral pleural effusions: on 4-5 L, suspect fluid overload as culprit

-could consider therapeutic thoracentesis if this would allow more aggressive fluid resuscitation, but should discuss with daughter first



ESRD: renal following, will consider HD tomorrow, pending labs/hemodynamics



h/o GI bleeds: hct seems stable without evidence for bleed as cause of shock, but follow Hct in AM



DM: SSI



HTN: holding anti-hypertensives



Goals of care: as above, no surgeries/invasive interventions/ICU level care



Med recon: PAML created from last discharge med list; have requested current med list from NGH, not yet received by fax



FEN:  

-boluses tonight as needed

-follow lytes

-NPO for now given mental status, active resuscitation



PPX:

-GI:  continue omeprazole if awake enough to take POs     

-DVT: subq heparin          

-BOWEL:  docusate/senna



Code Status:     DNR/DNI    (Discussed with patient&#8217;s daughter/HCP.)

Reason for Visit

Mr. Oshea is here for f/u of diabetes, other issues.  We increased his 70/30 insulin from 30 to 35U BID last month.  He has been keeping track of sugars at least BID since then.  He still has the majority of sugars in the low 200 range, some in the 300's, a few in the 100's.  Interestingly, his fasting sugars are for the most part higher than his daytime sugars.  He has not been adhering to a good diabetes diet - he enjoys a blueberry muffin from RR Donnelley daily.  His daughter-in-law who is also my patient has told me that he eats anything he wants and all the wrong things.  I addressed this issue w/ Mr. Oshea.  He says he tries, but he enjoys these things and feels he doesn't have much else in life to enjoy.  He is worried about his remaining vision.  He was told by Dr. Villagomez that the pressure in his L eye was unusually high.  She wants to see him back again this month for another exam and wants him to bring his eye drops.  He also is having trouble sleeping.  He never had a great sleep pattern since he worked as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and was up at all hours.  He has no trouble falling asleep, but wakes up about 2 a.m. every morning and can't fall back asleep.  He does take naps in the afternoon at times.

Attendings:  Dr.  Queen & Dr. Pineda



Source: Patient, pass-off, daughter-in-law



CC:  falls



HPI: Mr. Oshea is a pleasant 76-year-old male with a past medical history significant for DM, HTN, h/of CVA, and glaucoma who presents after increasing number of falls at home.  Pt lives with daughter-in-law and grandchildren, who were both recently sick and recovering from influenza.  The pt began to have a non-productive cough associated with a fever (101o-102o), watery eyes, diaphoresis, and chills early this week after his family was sick.  His daughter-in-law states that he has also been increasingly confused during this time period.  He has been confusing the time of day (confusing night for daytime and vice versa), increasingly forgetful, and falling more than usual.  He has been falling with increasing frequency over the last 3 months.  On average, he would fall about once a week.  On the day prior to admission, the pt walked to Procter Gamble (2 blocks from house) and fell twice.  He was helped back up by by-standers.  He describes the fall as his legs giving out from under him, and has been shuffling his gait more than usual recently.  During each fall he denies LOC, denies CP, denies, SOB, denies incontinence, and denies head trauma.  On the day of presentation, the daughter-in-law reports that the pt fell 13 times and when she could no longer help him rise called EMS.



EW Vital signs:  T:98.6o, P:99, BP:174/65, RR:20, SaO2: 91% on RA

EW: After the pt presented to the EW, he tested positive for influenza A and was treated supportively.  He was also noted to have a UTI and given a dose of antibiotics (levofloxacin and vancomycin).

CT Brain (2/27/88): 

1.  Atherosclerotic disease, extensive microangiopathic changes and chronic appearing lacunar infarcts, as described.  No specific evidence of acute infarction, although DW-MRI is more sensitive for acute ischemia.

2.  No intracranial hemorrhage.

	          	          	          

Assessment: 76yo M w/ history of DM, HTN, and h/o of CVA presents with AMS and increasing falls in setting of influenza.  



PLAN:   

1.	Delirium:  Pt's waxing and waning mental status likely secondary from his underlying infectious processes - influenza and UTI.  

a.	Correct hyponatremia

b.	Monitor mental status as infection is treated

2.	Falls:  Pt's recent falls likely have a multifactorial etiology.  Pt has many risk factors for falls including visual impairment, mild cognitive impairment (on MMSE), possible diabetic neuropathy, and 

a.	Check orthostatic vital signs

b.	Check RPR/B12

c.	Pt needs PT evaluation, may require walker or other equipment to help him ambulate

3.	Hypovolemic Hyponatremia: Pt clinically appears hypovolemic.  A FeNa of 0.5% also suggests a hypovolemic picture.

a.	Will check Na now, and if sodium continues to improve will continue IVFs

4.	UTI: Pt has positive U/A and UC for stap (awaiting speciation and sensitivity).  Staph is an unusual cause of a UTI.  A further investigation of the cause of source of the staph is warranted.  Empiric coverage with vancomycin is also necessary given the pt's history of methicillin and levofloxacin resistant CNS.

a.	F/u UC

b.	Empiric treatment with Vancomycin 1g q12h for 7 days (CrCl > 60), await c&s for possible alternative agents

5.	Influenza A

a.	Continuous oxygen monitoring

b.	Supportive care

6.	Code Status: Discussed with patient, who expressed to me he would like to be DNR/DNI

7.	PPx

a.	Nexium

b.	Fragmin

RILEY,MARY   631-07-92-1                      VISIT DATE: 02/13/62
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Abdominal pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 58-year-old 
non-English-speaking Hispanic woman who presents for evaluation of 
waxing and waning epigastric/right upper quadrant abdominal pain 
for the past five days.  The patient was in her usual state of 
health until one week ago, when she developed an upper respiratory 
tract infection.  She was seen by her primary care physician, who 
treated her with Biaxin.  The patient took the Biaxin; however, she 
developed some epigastric abdominal pain on Tuesday.  She called 
her primary care physician, who attributed her abdominal pain to a 
Biaxin reaction.  She was told to discontinue the Biaxin on Thursday. 
The patient denies any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
or constipation.  She denies any dysuria, polyuria, or hematuria. 
She denies any vaginal discharge.  She denies any shortness of 
breath or chest pain.  She denies any arm, jaw, or back pain.  She 
denies any diaphoresis or dizziness.  She does admit to some 
burping and indigestion. 
She describes the pain as cramping in nature.  It waxes and wanes. 
It does not radiate anywhere.  Nothing seems to improve or worsen 
the pain. 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As per HPI, and otherwise negative.  In 
particular, on cardiovascular review, she denies chest pain, arm 
pain, jaw pain, or back pain; she denies any diaphoresis, 
dizziness, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea on exertion, or palpitations. 
On pulmonary, she admits to cough, but denies hemoptysis.  The 
abdominal review is as per the HPI; she denies melena.  The GU 
review is as per HPI. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  (1) Type I diabetes mellitus; (2) 
Hypertension; (3) Hypothyroidism; (4) Asthma; (5) Current upper 
respiratory tract infection. 
MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler; glucophage; insulin; codeine. 
SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative tobacco.  The family 
history is negative for diabetes mellitus. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, the vital signs 
reveal a temperature of 98.6 degrees F., a blood pressure of 
146/74, a pulse of 88, and a respiratory rate of 20.  The O2 
saturation is 96% on room air.  In general, the patient is in no 
acute distress.  The HEENT examination reveals the head to be 
normocephalic; the examination is atraumatic.  EOMI.  PERLA.  The 
throat is clear.  The neck is supple, with no JVD or bruits.  The 
chest shows no crepitus or retractions.  The lungs have coarse 
breath sounds.  The heart has a regular rhythm and rate without 
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, with some very 
mild epigastric tenderness, but no guarding, rebound, referred 
pain, flank tenderness, palpable masses, or pulsatile masses.  The 
extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis, clubbing, 
or edema.  On neurologic, there are no focal findings. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The chest x-ray shows no acute pathology. 
The EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm at 90. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The working diagnosis was peptic 
ulcer disease exacerbation versus gastritis versus non-specific 
abdominal pain.  The patient was status post cholecystectomy five 
years ago.  She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  She did 
not exhibit any stigmata of an acute coronary syndrome; however, 
given her history of diabetes mellitus and her age, an EKG was 
obtained and revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 90, without any 
ischemic or infarctive changes.  She was medicated with 30 cc of 
Maalox and 150 mg of Axid, which seemed to improve her pain 
considerably.  Serial abdominal examinations did not reveal any 
peritoneal signs or worsening abdominal pain.  The patient did not 
have any medical records on the computer at this time.  Nursing and 
Triage notes were reviewed and I concur in those findings. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Abdominal pain, suspect gastritis versus peptic 
ulcer disease. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
given abdominal pain instructions in Spanish.  She was given a 
prescription for Axid and for Maalox.  She was to follow up with 
her primary care physician the next day and return if symptoms were 
to recur or worsen.  She was discharged in improved and stable 
condition.

EDVISIT^63107921^RILEY, MARY^10/22/2069^VOLLMER, NATHAN

Seen by Dr. Thrasher and seen and examined by me.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath.

Currently, being admitted to Internal Medicine.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 66-year-old woman with a

significant medical history including hypothyroidism, history of

high cholesterol, diabetes type 1, hypertension and history of

myocardial infarction in the past and status post cholecystectomy

who presents now with palpitations and shortness of breath.  Her

complaint is that for the last 5 days, she has had this bilateral

neck pain with shortness of breath.  She had no significant chest

pain, but complaining of dull achy pain and dull achy sensation

throughout her throat.  She felt some sensation of her heart

racing with her neck pain.  Mild headache.  No fevers however. 

She has had no diaphoresis or nausea and vomiting.  Blood

CC: Shortness of breath, neck pain.



HPI:  Ms. Riley was recently hospitalized in 11/69 for neck pain, chest pain, and SOB.  She had an extensive cardiovascular work-up that showed no signs of cardiac ischemia.  Her MIBI showed no evidence of scar or ischemia and an ejection fraction of 57%.  On the other hand, her blood sugars were found to be in the 300-400s.  Since then, she has been followed by the IM dept.  She comes in today complaining of 2 main symptoms that have been occuring for several months now, and which in large part led to her recent hospitalization: 1) dyspnea that occurs on average twice a week, allevaited after 30 min of SL NTG, no precipitating factors identified.  SOB not significantly imporved by albuterol.  2) neck pain, localized to the lateral aspects of her neck.  She feels ""her veins exploding"".  Of note, she suffered left ankle pain, for which she self-medicated cephalexin (without knowing its an Abx), which she had at home.  She says most of her symptoms resolved.  Per her husband, she has always been a fairly anxious person.  



ROS: No DOE, no PND, no fever.  Good apetite, polydypsia. Blurry vision.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  A total thyroidectomy, on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily, COPD, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, cholecystectomy and a meniscal tear.



CURRENT MEDICATIONS (updated)

1) Albuterol inhaler

2) Atenolol 50 mg p.o. daily

3) Clonidine HCL 0.2 mg p.o. b.i.d.

4) Aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily

5) Flovent 220 mcg b.i.d.

6) Levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily

7) Lisinopril 20 mg p.o. daily

8) Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily, 

9) Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

10) Humulin 70/30  90 U sc qAM, 70 U sc QPM

11) Metformin 1000 mg PO BID

12) SL NTG 0.3





SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years. Lives with her husband. Denies any tobacco or alcohol.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  

Weight: 215 lbs.  P 73, BP 122/74, SO2 97% RA

Gen: Well nourished.  Apperas well. Not pale. Obese

HEENT: PERRL. MMM. No LAN

Chest: CTA BL

CV: JVP flat. RRR. 2/6 systolic murmur LUSB. no r/g. S1 + single S2.

Abd: Soft. Non-tender. Obese.

Extrem: Warm. 1+ non-pitting edema.





IMPRESSION:  Ms. Riley is a 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, evidence of insulin resistance, most recent hemoglobin A1c was 9.4.  Her symptoms are quite vague and difficult to put together.  Importantly, myocardial ischemia has been ruled out by cardiac nucelar imaging.  My two main differentials are 1) general anxiety, 2) GERD.  Even though she does have a h/o COPD, but based on her history, physical exam and lack of efficacy of bronchodilators in releiveing her symptoms, I don't believe major underlying lung disease explans her symtoms.   We'll start her on klonopin 0.5 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg po qd.  Follow-up with LIMA psychiatry clinic for management of anxiety.



In terms of her glucose, she is improving, but still not adequately controlled.  She occasionally has blurry vision and is constantly thirsty.  Her next appointment is in January.  HBA1c yesterday=9.2, fasting glucose in the 200s.  Last increase in her insluin was in 11/30/69, from 80 U QAM to 90 U QPM.  For now, we'll increase her PM dose of insulin from 70 to 75 U SC QAM, and follow-up with her.. 







      

========================== Preceptor's Note ==========================

Discussed with Dr. Freddie Eric. 66 yo woman with poorly controlled DM. Recent admission for R/O MI. A1C was in the 9s. Being followed by Internal Medicine. Has odd sensation of numbness climbing from her toes to her chest associated with SOB and a sense that her neck is exploding. It would appear that she is having anxiety. We will treat with fluoxetine and Klonopin and refer to Psych. We will also adjust her insulin further.

****************************************************************************************************
Record date: 2070-11-29

 HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman who presents to Internal Medicine for followup.  Since her last visit, she has continued on her regimen of 70/30, 90 units in the morning and up to 90 units at dinnertime (sometimes 1/2 after dinner).  She also uses Lispro 25 units at lunch.  On this regimen, her morning blood sugars have ranged 
Pre-breakfast: 96-214, mostly 100-130.
Pre (sometimes post) Dinner: 128-307, mostly 140-160

The good news is her last A1c dropped to 7.2% from 8.3% (1 year ago was 10.4%)

She has known retinopathy and has had multiple laser treatments.  She goes routinely to the ophthalmologist, at least twice a year and several times a year to the podiatrist as well. She is otherwise in good health, though today she complains of depressed mood, for which she is in therapy. 

On ROS she denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, polyuria, polydipsia, fevers, chills, diarrhea, vaginal or urinary symptoms, numbness or tingling of her lower extremities.  She has not had any hypoglycemia.  She does not exercise.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Status post total thyroidectomy (because of large goiter) on levothyroxine 200 mcg daily. COPD, obesity, CHF (EF 40%), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, GERD, sleep apnea, status post cholecystectomy.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Albuterol inhaler, Ambien, atenolol 50 mg daily, clonidine 0.2 mg b.i.d., aspirin 81 mg daily, Flovent b.i.d., levothyroxine 200 mcg p.o. daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, Nexium 40 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg p.o. daily and Lipitor 20 mg p.o. nightly, Metormin 1000 mg BID, Lasix 20 mg daily.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Ms. Riley is from Mexico.  She has lived here for the last 15 years and denies tobacco or alcohol.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is a well-appearing overweight woman.  Blood pressure 117/57, pulse 87, weight 210 down fr 212 last visit, fingersticks 247 postprandial, reports took lispro today.  Extremities, no edema, well perfused with palpable pulses.  No ulcerations or skin breakdown. Microfilament and vibratory sensation intact.  

PREVIOUS DATA:  Labs from 11/22/70: TSH 0.137.  Microalbumin was negative.  Cholesterol was 109, LDL 40, HDL 36, TG 163 A1c 7.2%, down from 8.3% on 7/31/2070 

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  In summary, Ms. Riley is a 67-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes for the last 20 years with poor glycemic control, but significant improvement recently, with latest hemoglobin A1c of 7.2%.

1.  Diabetes.  Her sugars are much improved, as is her A1c. We will switch her 70/30 regular to 70/30 Novolog, given that she gives herself the insulin just after the meals and that she is using Novolog for lunch as well. We emphasized again the pm dose should NOT be pre-bed but pre-dinner.  She will continue dose of 90 units QAM and Qdinner of 70/30 and Lispro 25U for lunch. She will continue on metformin 1000 mg twice daily. She will continue to follow up with Opthalmology and Podiatry.  Her blood pressure is in target range on clonidine and lisinopril.  Her LDL is also in target range on Lipitor.   She will continue on a baby aspirin. Her microalbumin is negative.   

2.  Hypothyroidism.  TSH somewhat suppressed, 0.137, will therefore reduce levothyroxine to 175 mcg QD

She will follow up in 3-4 month's time.

The patient, Foust, was seen in the Emergency Department on

01/31/2095.  The patient was seen by Dr. Ferrer.  I have

discussed the management with him.  I have also seen the patient

personally and reviewed the ED record.  This is an addendum to

the record.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 64-year-old woman who said

this morning she went to the bathroom, was sitting on the

commode, felt chest tightness, and then had a syncopal episode. 

She has never had this chest tightness before.  She is unsure

whether she hit her head.  No shortness of breath and no

exertional symptoms in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As indicated and otherwise negative.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nonsmoker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is well appearing in no acute

distress.  She has no chest pain or discomfort within the chest

in the Emergency Department  Initial blood pressure systolic 218

was reduced to 190 range with beta blockade with initial pulse of

62.  She is normocephalic and atraumatic.  Neck has no midline

tenderness.  She has full range of motion without pain.  Chest is

bilaterally equal and clear.  Heart is regular.  Abdomen is soft

and nontender.  Extremities are nontender.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit of 40.2.  Initial CK and troponin

were negative.  EKG shows lateral ST depression, most prominent

in lead V4 through V6.  There is no old available for comparison

at this time.  She also has T-wave flattening in I and aVL.  On

repeated questioning, the patient has no symptoms.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  This is a woman who had a syncopal episode.

 She had chest tightness prior and has an abnormal EKG.  After

clearance of the head CT, which shows no bleed, the patient

received aspirin.  I have discussed admission with Dr. Melton who

is admitting for the Cardiology team and the patient has been

accepted.

DISPOSITION:  The patient is admitted.

EDVISIT^50294530^FOUST, FAY^12/14/95^FISHER, CARRIE
The patient was seen in conjunction with Dr. Dickerson.  I confirm

that I have interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the

resident's documentation on the patient's chart, discussed the

evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest tightness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, a 65-year-old female with

hypertension and atypical chest pain who comes in with bilateral

chest tightness since 11:00 a.m. and stated that she feels very

lousy after taking her meds and daily has been getting chest

tightness since her discharge recently in which she was admitted

for weakness and hypertensive urgency.  The patient stated that

she feels like a ""dead mouse.""  She admits to some headache,

dizziness and continued chest discomfort despite medications. 

She had a negative MIBI and neurological workup and has had

significant adjustment for hypertensive medications.  Initial

blood pressure is 239/99 upon arrival.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension and reflux.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.  No tobacco, drugs or

alcohol.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As documented per written chart.

MEDICATIONS:  As per medication list.

ALLERGIES:  Penicillin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Afebrile.  Vital signs stable except for

high blood pressure.  Awake and alert female, in some obvious

mild discomfort.  HEENT:  Atraumatic and normocephalic.  Neck: 

Soft and supple.  Lungs:  Clear.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and

nondistended.  Skin:  Intact, warm, and dry.  Neurologic:  Alert,

oriented, and moving extremities x4.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  IV placed.  Labs sent.  EKG is

done.  The patient concerned for hypertensive urgency given the

chest pressure and dizziness.  We will give ____ 10 mg IV given

the significantly elevated systolic despite compliance with her

hypertensive medication regime to include lisinopril, Toprol-XL,

hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine, and apparently had a hard time

with blood pressure control in hospital as well.  I spoke with

PCP coverage.  Given the patient's symptoms and degree of change

of medications, we would admit for further titration of

hypertensive medications in addition, with cycle enzymes.  The

patient understands and agrees with plan.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Hypertensive urgency.

DISPOSITION:  Admit to ____.

3.  12/95 EGD and biopsies for chest discomfort, gastritis.  No metaplasia.  H. pylori negative.  

4.  11/95 MRI:  Probable cholelithiasis.

5.  Never smoked.  No ethanol usage.  

6.  No family history of coronary artery disease.  

7.  Hypertension, with vigorous left ventricular systolic function and a rigid vasculature, with severe chest and back discomfort with elevated pressures. 

A.  Long use of losartan/hydrochlorothiazide and  during 01/95 admission for post narcotic lightheadedness, blood pressure noted to be significantly elevated.  

B.  11/95 complaints of chest tightness and blood pressure above 230 mmHg systolic.  Chest discomfort improved with lower blood pressure.  

C.  11/95 investigations for hypertension:  BUN below 10, creatinine 0.6, potassium 3.6, calcium 9.1, TSH 2.17.  Cortisol level 16.  Urine for metanephrine and catecholamines unremarkable.  Right kidney reportedly 9.3 and left 10.2 on ultrasound, left renal artery velocity 2.7 meters/second, suggestive of 50 to 75% stenosis, but MRA only mild left renal artery ostial stenosis.  

D.  01/96, for ongoing poor blood pressure control, lisinopril increased, atenolol added, hydralazine utilized p.r.n., and ultimately carvedilol suggested, in place of atenolol,  at low initial dose.  
E.  02/96, admitted with chest pain and yet poorly-controlled hypertension, much improved with progressive increase in carvedilol and with addition of amlodipine.  03/96, BUN 14, creatinine 0.7, potassium 4.0.  Under item 9 add a sentence:  The patient feels that p.m. lisinopril can be associated with slight leg swelling but encouraged to continue the medication.  Then we will add an item 11C that will say:  02/96, CTA:  Normal left main, 30% to 40% plaques in proximal LAD, 20% to 30% LCX proximal plaques, mid RCA 30% to 50% plaques, distal vessels visualized well.

11.  Last cardiac/structural functional studies for chest discomfort that was present in 01/95, but that became worse in 11/95, associated with elevations in blood pressure and improved with carotid sinus massage during exam on 01/96.  

A.  01/95 and 11/95 EDD 4.3.  ESD 2.6.  Wall thickness 1.4.  EF 70%.  LA 4.  RA 3.9.  RV EDD 2.3.  Early relaxation abnormality.  Minimal aortic valve sclerosis.  

B.  11/95 6 minutes 21 seconds standard Bruce, heart rate 112.  Then received adenosine, and there were no new ST segment changes atop baseline inferolateral ST segment depressions.  No wall motion abnormalities.  EF 70%.  



Dear Bethany: 


I saw your patient, Fay Foust, in my office today.  Mrs. Foust is a 65-year-old woman who is feeling significantly improved, but who complains of dizziness after she takes her medications.  Her history of severe hypertension, without definite secondary causes, only a mild left renal artery stenosis, a recent admission for chest discomfort and hypertension, with a CTA that disclosed only modest plaques in her 3 major coronary arteries, treated dyslipidemia, type II diabetes, and vigorous left ventricular systolic function and significant left ventricular hypertrophy, is detailed above.  


Ms. Foust feels that her life has been brought back to her.  She takes her amlodipine, lisinopril, and carvedilol at 8:30 a.m.  Thirty minutes later, she states that she feels lightheaded and her blood pressure can be in the 100/70 mmHg range to 120/80 mmHg range.  She believes that her heart rate is approximately 60 beats per minute at those times.  After 1-2 hours, she starts to feel improved.  At 8:30 p.m., when she takes only her carvedilol and amlodipine, again, she has similar symptoms.  When she has the symptoms, she sometimes also notices a discomfort in her low back.  She has not had dyspnea and she has only rare episodes of mild chest heaviness.  She has not had palpitations.  She has not had actual lower extremity swelling, though she feels that after her metformin, her legs can feel heavy.  She is not having an alteration in gastrointestinal or genitourinary habits. She has not had musculoskeletal achiness, aside from the low back discomfort described.  She has not had any peripheral numbness.  The rest of the review of systems is unremarkable.  


The present medications are ASA 81 mg a.m., lisinopril 40 mg a.m., amlodipine one-half of a 10 mg tablet a.m., carvedilol 25 mg a.m. and 25 mg evening, simvastatin 40 mg before bedtime, and metformin 500 mg before dinner. 


On examination, the weight is 110 pounds, decreased 3 pounds compared to 01/96.  The blood pressure was initially 136/60 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate 12, and she was complaining of low back discomfort, and she was very slightly lightheaded.  Later, the blood pressure was 160/70 mmHg and she stated that her blood pressure has not been so high for the last several weeks.  She was still complaining of slightly dizziness and low back discomfort.  The skin is warm and dry and she looks quite calm.  She is fully alert.  The neck veins are not elevated.  The carotid upstrokes are brisk and the volumes are normal.  There are no carotid bruits though there was a transmitted murmur.  The lungs are clear.  The PMI is not displaced.  There is a normal-sounding S1 and a physiologically split S2, with a soft, 2/6 early-peaking systolic murmur across the aortic valve that decreases with Valsalva.  The abdomen is benign. There is no renal artery bruit.  The distal pulses remain excellent and there is no pedal edema.  There is no tenderness of her skin.  The resting electrocardiogram shows a sinus bradycardia at a rate of 56 beats per minute, intervals of 0.20/0.08/0.40, 45-degree axis, very slight inferolateral ST segment flattening. 


Impression:  Mrs. Foust is feeling much-improved.  The dizziness and low back discomfort that she describes could possibly be associated with a drop in blood pressure to 170 mmHg, with mild hypoperfusion of her spinal arteries, as well as her head.  However, today she had dizziness even with a blood pressure of 160 mmHg.  Though we could be tempted to juggle with her regimen and reduce her amlodipine slightly, or change the times when she takes the medications, I think that we are facing some difficulties only related to the poor autoregulation of her cerebral and peripheral vessels.  I think that we should continue her on her present regimen.  Gradually, we would expect her symptoms, related to changes in blood pressure, to improve as her vessel elasticity improves.  I think that we can be satisfied that she is not becoming too bradycardic.  We are pleased with the present regimen.  We have never been absolutely certain that there has been no tiny penetrating aortic ulcer for her discomforts or so dramatic, but the treatment would be precisely as it is now.  We were not surprised by her CTA and her treatment, naturally, remains unchanged.  I think that we want her to continue her metformin, and we may have to consider increasing it to at least twice daily, depending on followup A1c values.  


Thank you for allowing me to assist in Mrs. Foust's care.  I know that you will continue to follow her closely.  I told her that I would see her again in nine months.  


Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Gustafson, 


I have just received your test results and I would like to share them with you.



Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 7.30 on 01/29/2123. It has remained stable compared to the last value of 7.10 on 10/29/2122. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months. We would like to keep it below 7.


I suggest a trial of metformin 500mg twice daily
test your sugars to keep below 140 2 hours after meals

If you have any questions about these results, please do not hesitate to contact me.

	Interval History:
   CC/ID: 60 yo female w/ CRFs of DM2, HTN, Chol admitted after +ETT.

HPI: The pt has not had any significant recent CV history.  When pressed, she notes that about 6 months ago, she had an episode of mild chest tightness while at rest which was not particularly severe nor was it exacerbated or relieved by any measures.  These sx occurred only once, and lasted for a ""few hours"" before abating.  She reports that she thought it might be ""heartburn,"" though she is not prone to dyspepsia.  Subsequently, she denies any exertional dyspnea, CP, jaw or arm pain, belching, post-prandial discomfort, ""heartburn"" or palpitations.  She has not had any sx of CHF including pnd, orthopnea or LE edema.  Moreover, she denies claudication (legs or arms).  She reports that she has a ""sedentary"" lifestyle, but still carries groceries, does laundry, and usual housework without limitation.  She presented to her PCP Dr. Ong for an annual physical recently and on ECG, he noted new inferior Q waves and referred her for ETT which she had today.  As noted below, she had an early positive ECG with NO symptoms of angina, but with marked light-headedness with STD and bigeminy lasting up to 20' into recovery.  Scans were notable for EF 51% with inferior HK and an inferior fixed defect and inferolateral ischemia.  She was then transferred to BH ED and here to MMC for angiography.

	Assessment and plan:
   60 yo female w/ panvascular disease with evidence of silent IMI with residual peri-infarct ischemia now w/ early + ETT with symptomatic L SC Steal during exertion (dizziness) along with coronary ischemia.  From a global perspective, she must have her coronary ischemia addressed with definitive assessment of her coronary anatomy given her high-risk ETT.  I have discussed the rationale, risks and benefits of diagnostic angiography, and she understands and is willing to proceed.  She understands that revascularization decisions will be dynamic and may include PCI or CABG (or medical rx).  She must also have aggressive secondary prevention measures instituted as well as a more deliberate assessment of her L SCA stenosis and steal syndrome, as this may in fact become overtly manifest should the L SCA stenosis worsen.

1) CAD: ASA 325mg daily, Statins to LDL&lt;70mg/dL, Low dose BB for now along with ACEI to R arm BP of 140s/80s for now.  NPO after midnight with plans for coronary angiography (+/- LSCA angiogram) and possibly renal angiography given severe hypertension and systemic atherosclerosis.  Will discuss with Drs. Harper/Kumar tomorrow.  Suggest LHC (cross valve), Cors, L SCA angio/gradient, LVG.  She does not seem to have any obvious contra-indications to DES (bleeding diathesis, upcoming procedures, etc)
2) L SCA stenosis with steal: Angiography will be the most expeditious way to evaluate the significance of this.  She denies arm claudication, but should she need the LIMA for CABG, the prox L SCA will need to be addressed.
3) Secondary prevention as above
4) DM: Will need medical rx on d/c.  Follow sugars while in house
5) PAD: Consider ABIs to establish baseline after d/c.

Imaging:
Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.  No acute intracranial process.

Head MRI/MRA: pending


Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.  Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.  Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.  She has no face or leg weakness.

Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.  However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.

Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.

Recommendations:
-Head and neck MRI/MRA
-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
-Continue statin.
-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 


We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Franklin Feliciano. 


Ruath Doss is a 58yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, and hypercholesterolemia who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She was last seen here March 4th, at which time she was having difficulty tasting food.  This finding was not replicated on clinical exam, and her exam was otherwise unremarkable; it was theorized that her symptoms may have been due to a drastic alteration in her diet.  Less likely possibilities included a viral illness and side effect of hydrochlorthiazide.  Otherwise, she had recovered well from her strokes, and had not had additional seizures.  


Mrs. Doss continues to do well.  She reports that her taste came back eventually; she did stop the hydrochlorthiazide under your direction, but is not sure if it was associated with the recovery of her taste.  She continues to eat healthfully, and in fact has lost 30 lbs since her hospitalization.  Via your office, she has completed a cardiac stress test as recommended after suffering a NSTEMI during her last hospitalization.  She has had an abdominal ultrasound which may have shown a gallstone, although she is unsure of the exact results.  Finally, she informs me that an appointment with Dr. Yuhas of Neurosurgery has been scheduled for August in order to follow up an incidental small L A2 aneurysm.  


Mrs. Doss continues to take Plavix for secondary stroke prevention (she has G6PD deficiency).  Her dentist would like to take her off this medication for a week before an extensive outpatient procedure which would include deep root cleaning.  However, she is nervous about the risk of another stroke.  She continues to tolerate her Dilantin well; there had been a question in April about a low level, but the test had been inadvertently performed in the setting of a held dose, and on repeat testing was within goal at 12.6.  She denies any seizure-like activity: no staring or shaking spells, or episodes of incontinence or tongue biting.  She reminds me that her 6 month anniversary of seizure free activity is approaching, and thus is hoping that she might be able to resume driving.  


She denies changes in vision, focal weakness or numbness, difficulty with language comprehension or production.  She does have occasional mild headaches exacerbated by the summer heat.  She sometimes feels as though she has ""creepy crawly things in my head,"" a sensation similar to when she had a Mohs procedure.

Studies: 
CTA head (5/01/90): No significant interval change in the distal left A2 segment aneurysm.


Assessment and Recommendations:


58yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.   She is overall doing very well, and has been very meticulous with her healthcare after her hospitalizations in December.  We discussed the very small risk of stroke if Plavix is held for a dental procedure.  The daily risk of stroke is so small, and the benefit of proper mouth care so great, that we would agree with holding clopidogrel.  If she does not want to stop antiplatelet medication before the procedure, the only alternative would be a heparin or Lovenox bridge.  However, such a measure would seem to be extreme, especially as her overwhelming stroke risk factors at the time of the CVA were her diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which she has taken significant strides to better control.  Mrs. Doss was still nervous about suspending the Plavix; ultimately, she will decide on the optimal course of action.  


Mrs. Doss will have repeat cholesterol panel tested at your office to assess her response to the increased dose Lipitor and dietary changes.  Her lipoprotein(a) level was high at 89 at the time of her hospitalization, and we will repeat this lab today to ascertain whether it has remained elevated.  I have also written her a letter certifying that, as of July 3rd, she will have been seizure free for 6 months time on a stable dose of Dilantin.  She emphasizes that she would call my office or go to the Emergency Department immediately if there she were to have any seizure-like episodes.  If she remains event free for two years, we may consider discontinuing her antiepileptic medication.  


Although the incidentally noted L A2 aneurysm is reassuringly stable on CTA, I have asked her to confirm her follow up appointment with Neurosurgery, as I do not see the date noted in the computer.  Finally, we will obtain a repeat carotid ultrasound this fall to ensure that the irregular R ICA plaque has not progressed.  
Of note, Dr. Franklin Feliciano was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to participate in the care of your patient. I will see her back in clinic in 4-6 months time.   




Sincerely,

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tingling and numbness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 58-year-old woman with a

history of stroke and seizure in 12/2089 and a longstanding

history of diabetes who presents today with a sharp thumbtack

poking sensation in her right hand at 9:30 a.m. while driving. 

It lasted 3-4 seconds and then completely resolved.  Thirty

minutes later, she noticed a similar sensation in her right hand

for a few seconds and then resolved completely, and then she

noticed it in her right foot and the toes.  She wiggles her toes

in her shoe and then that resolved after a few seconds and then

30 minutes after that she had a similar but less severe sensation

in the fingertips of her left hand at about 10:45 that then

resolved completely.  Since then, she has had no sensation like

this.  She has had pins and needles feeling in her hands and feet

in the past, but never a sharp thumbtack feeling like this in the

past.  She had no dysarthria, confusion, weakness, numbness

trauma, dizziness, loss of consciousness, syncope, seizure

activity, changes in her medications, or any new medications. 

She took her Plavix as usual this morning, is now symptom free,

and very well appearing.  She called her doctor's office and the

nurse told her to come to the Emergency Department to be checked.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol,

seizures in the setting of a stroke in 12/2089, and a left MCA

stroke in 12/2089.  She has had no seizures since then.  She has

residual right lower extremity weakness, which is now much

improved.  Echo in 12/2089 showed an EF of 60%.  She has

concentric LVH, no wall motion abnormalities, and no other

surgeries.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Past smoker of 30 pack years, ETOH none, and no

IV drug use.  She works as a Business Services Manager and lives

with her family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She takes Dilantin, glipizide, Glucophage, Plavix,

atenolol, Cozaar, and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is afebrile with normal and stable

vital signs.  Awake, alert, and in no distress.  Her exam is

completely unremarkable including 5/5 strength in her upper and

lower extremities.  Gait is normal.  She has no cerebellar signs,

past pointing dysmetria, aphasia, ataxia, focal weakness, or any

focal sensory deficit at all.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows bradycardia at 50 beats a minute with

nonspecific T-wave changes.  Fingerstick is 150.  Dilantin level

is normal.  Head CT shows no evidence of bleeding or any other

abnormality.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Neurology was consulted and agrees

with the diagnosis of likely peripheral neuropathy.  They will

help arrange followup within 1 week for this patient with her

neurologist and she is told to see her primary care physician

within 2 weeks and to return to the Emergency Department for any

chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other worsening of her

symptoms.

DISPOSITION:  She is well appearing at the time of discharge in

satisfactory condition.

Dear Nurse Rivas, 




We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro. 





Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.  She was last seen here in December 2091. 
Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.  Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.  However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.  



Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.  She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.  She denies any recent seizures.  After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.  






Medications:

atenolol 50mg qday

hctz 12.5mg qday

Lipitor 80mg qday

Percocet 5/325, 1/2 tab prn, takes very infrequently

Valium 5-10mg prn, takes very rarely

Loratadine 10mg prn

Ibuprofen 1 tab qday

Trazodone 150mg qhs prn, takes rarely

Gait:  Posture, stance, stride, and arm-swing normal. Able to walk on heels and toes. Tandem gait intact. Romberg negative. 





Assessment and Recommendations:



60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.  Her clinical examination remains intact.  She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.  Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.  Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.  Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.  If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).  After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.  She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.  



We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.  The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.  (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.  



Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     





Sincerely, 






Yasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD

MR#: 2554172

Date: 10/29/92
PCP: Paul Eggleston

Cardiology: Youmans



CC: emesis, light-headedness 



HPI: 85 y/o with CAD and active ischemia on 6/87 stress test (medically managed) who was feeling well until last night.  During the day yesterday, he went on his daily walk with his wife and felt fine.  In the evening around 8:30 pm, he experienced dull, 8/10 pain under both arm pits which resolved within 20 minutes after taking 3 SL TNG 5 mins apart.  He denies SOB, N/V, radiation or diaphoresis associated with this arm pain.  He states that he gets similar bilateral underarm pain about twice per week which is usually relieved by a single SL TNG within 10-15 mins.  The arm pain is not exertional.

	After the arm pain relieved last night, the pt took 3 Aleve tabs which his daughter bought for him for arthritis pain.  A couple of hours later, he became nauseated and had a single episode of    dark brown    emesis.  After vomiting, he felt light-headed while walking around the house.  He had a bowel movement this AM which he states was darker than usual, almost black looking.  He denies BRBPR, abdominal pain, CP, SOB, palpitations, headache, fever or chills.

	In the setting of significant fatigue and light-headedness, the pt presented to the ED this morning.  Admission vitals: 97.2, 120/78, HR 80's, RR12, sats 97% RA.  He was noted to be in A fib.  Hct was 22 (down from 38 last week).  NG lavage was not performed in the ED.  However, he did have another episode of bilateral arm pain which was relieved by SL TNG x 3.  HR at the time of arm pain was in the 80's and ECG showed A fib with possible TWI in I,L and V6 but relatively unchanged from admission ECG without pain.  He subsequently received lopressor 2.5 IV/12.5 PO, isordil 10 PO and zantac 50 IV.

Studies:

EKG  AF (92) LAD TWI I,L,V6

CXR  IMPRESSION:

	There are linear opacities at both bases consistent with

	subsegmental atelectasis. Bilateral calcified pleural plaques are

	consistent with asbestos exposure. There is no pneumothorax. No

pleural effusions are visualized.  There is extensive change including both shoulders.



Assessment:  85 y/o with medically management multivessel CAD who presents with light-headedness, fatigue and anemia.  Likely coffee gound emesis, melana and increased BUN concerning for UGIB.  Given history of alcohol consumption (suspect that consumption may be slightly more than given by history) and NSAID use, gastritis is a possibility.  No clear reason for other sources of UGIB.  Pt also found to be in Afib of unknown duration.  Unclear if Afib was prompted by anemia due to UGIB.



Plan:



1.	UGIB

a.	Active blood back sample, IV access

b.	Hct increased from 22.2 to 24.7 after 2u pRBCs.  Given CAD history, will transfuse one more unit

c.	GI consult for possible EGD (pt likely also needs colonoscopy given h/o tubular adenoma)

d.	IV zantac 

e.	Hold aspirin for now

2.	CV

a.	Ischemia - TVI on admission on ECG from ED.  Will cycle cardiac enzymes.  Hold aspirin for now given GIB.  Continue beta blocker both for ischemia protection and AF rate control; will hold other anti-hypertensives for now

b.	Rhythm - unclear duration of Afib so immediate cardioversion not an option (avoid TEE in the setting of UGIB); lopressor for rate control; no anticoagulation for now; central telmetry

c.	Pump - no active issues 

3.	increased WBC 

a.	unclear etiology ? reactive

b.	Afebrile, no signs of infection; will follow

4.	diabetes

a.	SSI

MISSOULA CLINIC CENTER



Reason for visit

	

  88 year old man h/o type 2 DM, CAD here for follow up



History of present illness

	

  He missed his last appointment, but today he states that he has been feeling fine. He reports no chest pain, no dyspnea, no palpitations, no orthopnea, no PND. He is ambulating around the house without a problem. He has some occasional leg pains, but he now takes acetaminophen instead of nitroglycerin. He reports no recent ankle swelling, because he states that he elevates his legs. 



He cares for his wife- doing chores around the house, such as washing dishes or making the bed. The only thing he reports being unable to do is lifting arms over his head (old problem).



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

s/p anterior MI 2082, LAD PTCA 2082. Cath 90% RCA, occluded OM2 2082. Echo 2087 EF =67%, no WMA (previously had apical dyskinesis). R/I'd for NSTEMI (TnT 1.35) in setting of 4 U GI Bleed (11/92), complicated by CHF. Last LDL 59 on lovastatin.



Osteoarthritis

Severe DJD of bilat shoulder -limited abduction 80 degrees. No significant symptoms. Seen by Dr. Etheridge in past.



Diabetes mellitus

Dx 7/88, on low dose glucophage with excellent control- d/c'd 10/91 when HbA1C all wnl. Urine alb slightly high at 71 (8/94). HbA1C up to 8.0%- started on glyburide. Last check 6.7%



Active Medications



aspirin 81mg po qd

atenolol 100mg po qd

furosemide 20 mg po 2-3 tabs daily

glyburide 1.25mg po qd take with breakfast or first meal

lisinopril 2.5 mg po qd

lovastatin 20mg po qpm take with food

multivitamins 

nitroglycerin 0.3mg AS DIRECTED



Social history

	

  Married, 4 daughters from previous marriage. 3 sons each killed in separate MVA. Former smoker quit 20 years ago, (+) EtOH. 11 grandchildren, 9 GGC



Procedures and Immunizations 

Influenza vaccine 

 Received 11/95 MLL



Review of systems

	

  As above, no abdominal pain, no urinary complaints. No complaints of constipation or rectal pain. No BRBPR. Nocturia x 1-2. Rest negative in detail.



Physical Exam

Blood pressure 124/70  

Pulse 68  irregular

Cor   RRR, normal s1, wide split s2, no murmur

Abdomen   soft NT no masses

Extrem   No edema, radial pulses 2+, popliteal/DP 1+, DJD at base of 1st MC right



Selected recent labs

	

  EKG- AF at 68, new RBBB, LAH. 

CMP/CBC/HbA1C

Urine for albumin



Assessment and plan

	

  1. AF: recurrence of his AF, but no significant CHF and no symptoms to suggest active ischemia. He is already rate controlled on beta blocker. Decision to anti-coagulate is not easy. On one hand, he is a very functional man. On the other hand, he is 88, walks with a cane for balance, and is not very fond of frequent doctors visits. Discussed EKG findings and anticoagulation with Dr. Youmans, his cardiologist. Dr. Youmans will see patient next week. 

2. CAD/CHF: Stable- Continue ASA/BB/ACEI/statin. BP OK. 

3. DM: HbA1C normal on low dose glyburide. (+) microalb- on ACEI- check again today. 

4. PUD: no recent bleeding. No symptoms. 

5. HCM: Flushot 11/95. Declines c-scope (last 2087).

He was seen one week ago in clinic, and appeared medically stable. Gait was normal. He had a return of AF in March, but rate was controlled and there was no CHF. Evaluation with Dr. Youmans was planned this week for ? start anticoagulation. 



On Friday, June 19, he fell backwards in the kitchen while at the sink. He reports no headache, dizziness, chest pain, dyspnea, palpitations, or pain before the fall. He struck his head and back. No LOC. On Wednesday June 21, his family called to report he was unsteady and feeling dizzy. He was referred to the MCC ER.

Review of systems: As above, no abdominal pain, no urinary complaints. No complaints of constipation or rectal pain. No BRBPR. Nocturia x 1-2. No dysuria, no hematuria, no incontinence. Rest negative in detail. 



Physical Exam: Elderly man appears well 

Blood pressure: 130/70's 

Pulse: 82 irregular 

Respiratory rate: 12-16 

Weight: 136

Neck: carotids 1+, JVP 6 cm, no nodes, thyroid non palpable 

Chest: CTA 

Cor: Irregular, normal s1, wide split s2, no murmur

EKG: Af, LAD, RBBB, old inferior MI, No ST depressions or TWI (no change from 3/96 EKG) 



Head CT with right caudate nucleus lacune 



MRI/MRA: small chronic infarct in the right caudate with porencephalic changes. Apparent moderate stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery 



Chest CT: No acute displaced fracture or dislocation. Multiple large mediastinal lymph nodes, largest in right paratracheal region. Findings may be reactive. Follow up is recommended if clinically indicated. Pleural calcifications with associated nodules, also seen on prior examination. Findings likely represent asbestos exposure. 



Echo: moderate MR, EF 46%, inferoapical HK/AK, Elevated RVSP 88 



A/P: 

88 year old man s/p mechanical fall, perhaps some orthostasis due to NTG or postprandial state. He looks baseline. Testing has revealed a number of abnormalities but do not think this is directly related to presentation. 



1. s/p fall: evaluate with PT, check orthostatics after meal. Back pain likely muscular- no fracture- treat with low dose oxycodone 

2. UTI: on levofloxacin, await culture 

3. CAD/CHF: appears euvolemic, ruled out for MI. Resume outpatient lasix and ACEI if BP allows. Echo shows Inferoapical HK, and high RV pressures- ? volume overload, ? pulmonary disease. Will ask Dr. Youmans to advise on management. 

4. Chronic lacunar stroke: already on ASA/statin. 

5. Mediastinal adenopathy: no work up in hospital. 

6. DM: May continue oral agents, check FS glucose. 



He would like to go home ASAP- he is not interested in many tests, and goal will be to d/c home with services.

Time: 11:00AM 
Patient: Walton, Levi
MR#: 2554172
GI Attending: Navarrete, Pamela
DOA: 12/18/2096


REASON FOR CONSULT: HCT drop, guaiac +


HPI:
89M admitted on 12/18 with hypotension and HCT drop.


The patient was admitted on Dec 13th and seen by Dr. Esposito from GI.  Per her note, he was admitted with ""complaints of vomiting up food and constant chest pain for 3-4 days. He reports that he has had some troubles with food for the past few months but can't define precisely what the troubles were. It seems that he intermittently vomited or regurgitated both liquids and solids and had a sensation of something getting stuck in his chest. Over the last 3-4 days everything he ate or drank, including water, would come up. He denies nausea. There is no abdominal pain but he describes a constant pain across his chest at the level of his nipples for the past 3-4 days. His pain is currently controlled. He denies pain on swallowing. He does report some weight loss but is unable to identify how much. He denies any new neurologic deficits or headaches.  A barium swallow was obtained which showed a fixed narrowing in the distal esophagus. He has a hx of gastric and duodenal ulcers on endoscopy from 2092 in the setting of NSAID use. He had a normal colonoscopy in 2087.""


During that admission. He underwent upper endoscopy that showed severe esophagitis. Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.  The duodenum was normal. He was discharged on December 15th with HCT 31.3.


The patient now returns with HCT drop to 19 and hypotension. He reports continued difficulty swallowing and some nausea, vomiting. ""Everything comes up."" He says this has been persistent since his discharge.  He also reports continued black stools since discharge as well. No clear BRBPR. His wife notes one episode of hematemesis yesterday.  No lightheadedness, dizziness, DOE, SOB.  In the ED, hypotensive to 60's / 70's SBP, HCT 19, his ABD CT was negative. INR  pending. He was started on pressors (levophed and vasopressin) and transferred to the MICU for ongoing care.


Currently the patient has no abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or BRBPR.

STUDIES:
Dec 13th EGD
Impression: - LA Grade D esophagitis. It could represent 
reflux esophagitis, Barrett's esophagitis or 
underlying malignancy. Biopsied.
- Two gastric ulcers with clean bases in the 
prepyloric area which were biopsied.
- Normal examined duodenum.
 
IMPRESSION: 
89M with PMH gastric ulcers and severe esophagitis who returns with HCT drop.  In the setting of guaiac positive stool, he may have bleeding from his gastric ulcers or from the severe esophagitis that was seen endoscopically last week.  He may have a visible vessel at the ulcer site.  Alternatively, he may have a Mallory-Weiss Tear from the wretching due to persistent nausea and vomiting.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS:


1. Please make Patient NPO
2. Please ensure two large bore IV's are in place
3. Active Type and Cross
4. HCT checks TID
5. IV PPI
6. Plan EGD today once resuscitated7.
7. Please check INR and reverse if needed. With an elevated lactate, he may be septic.




Thank you for allowing us to participate in this patient's care.  Please page with any additional questions.

Otto Qazi
MR# 527-62-21
Date of Admission: January 12, 2083
Admitting JAR: Hunter Hayden, MD
Attending:  Quinten Prado, MD

Reason for Transfer: STEMI

HPI:   
58yoM with h/o CAD, HTN, smoking; presents to FHO with chest pain and found to have lateral STEMI.  He experienced mild central chest pain on the night prior to admission while working outdoors, pain resolved after about an hour and he attributed it to GERD.  However, he awoke at 5:30 AM on the morning of presentation with recurrence of chest pain, 6/10 severity, lasted for about 15-30 minutes and then resolved with Maalox.  Pain recurred about 9:30, of similar severity, associated with dyspnea, diaphoresis, non radiating, non-pleuritic.  He again took zantac and Maalox without improvement.  After 15 minutes he walked to the local hospital ER and during walk the pain increased in severity to 8/10.  He describes the pain as similar to his previous MI.

Upon arrival to FHO found to have ST elevations antero-lateral.  Given lopressor, heparin, integrillin, morphine, ASA, and medivac to WCH arranged for cath.  He states that by the time he was in transit, his chest pain had resolved.  He arrived at WCH, was taken directly to cath lab, found to have a proximal LAD lesion with cypher stent placed.  He remained chest pain free following the procedure and was sent to the CCU in stable condition.

At baseline he states he can walk    a couple    of miles without rest, he rarely takes stairs on a daily basis.  He smokes profusely and has little interest in quitting.  He feels he has had no occurrence of chest pain since last one.  However, he does report that his plavix was stopped recently, and he has difficulty affording all his medications.

Explained how to use it.

5.  Nodular hyperpigmented lesion on her forefeet.  I will refer

her to Dermatology for evaluation of this lesion, but the patient

says that it has been there for as long as she can remember but

it is quite atypical to my exam.

6.  Left renal cystic mass.  She has been scheduled for a

follow-up MRI for December 13.

7.  Asthma:  She is doing stably in this regard and I believe

that nasal spray will help substantially with her symptoms.

Chief Complaint	

Mrs Chapman  is here today to follow up on HTN, DM 



History of Present Illness	

I saw her 2/24/87 for HTN and DM. BP was high and increased Lisinopril to 20 mg QD

Restarted Lipitpr but she still is not taking it. The pharmacy didn't give it to her. Her LDL is 116 ono 2/87 and has DM, goal <100.

Feels well. 

Had an ETT MIBI few weeks ago and no evidence of ischemia.

Denies CP, SOB, palpitations

Started walking daily around Woodstown about 3.5 miles and has lost 7 pounds since I saw her. Also eating more vegetables and fruits and less carbohydrates.



Third, she had a renal U/S done for hematuria and showed small left renal mass. Had a CT scan later that showed the same and recommended an MRI. She had it done few 9/86. Recommended to repeat it soon. Left lower pole renal lesion with MRI signal characteristics consistent with a cystic, septated, unenhancing renal lesion or bosniak grade 2. However, when compared to prior CT examination demonstrating late filling of this lesion, follow up is warranted to exclude a cystic renal neoplasm making this an overall bosniak grade 2F. 





Review of Systems	

C/P: Denies PND, orthopnea. Leg swelling after walking around the pond

General: Denies fever, chills

HEENT : No cold sx

The patient returns for a follow up visit on her diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure.  She is regularly being followed by Dr. Jarvis, Nephrologist at Salvation Army Hospital, was seen there about two months ago and will return there in June.  She is also treated for her chronic anemia with darbopoetin.  The patient recently has noticed that her blood sugars have decreased progressively, and she has had several episodes of near hypoglycemia.  Blood sugars are often 60 or less.  The patient also complains of pain in her right middle finger and right shoulder pain.



Physical examination reveals an elderly female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 142/60, weight is 176 pounds, and pulse is 96.  Glucose done in the exam room today was 110.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2, negative S3, S4, and no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, and positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities: No edema and nontender.  Right hand tenderness in the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the overlying tendon and also tenderness diffusely in the right shoulder pain with grossly normal range of motion.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Diabetes mellitus.  The patient's blood sugars have been dropping.  The patient has decreased her glipizide already from 20 mg daily to 10 mg daily.  I will further decrease it to 5 mg daily.  Check hemoglobin A1c today as well as ALT, AST, and creatinine.

2.  Chronic renal failure.  The patient's creatinine clearance is about 15-17, and the patient is approaching end-stage renal failure.  She is being followed by the Renal Department at Salvation Army Hospital, and dialysis is being considered for the midterm management of the patient.

3.  Tendonitis, right middle finger.  After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

4.  Anemia.  This is obviously due to the patient's chronic renal disease.  She has been receiving darbepoetin injections, initially weekly, then every other week, and now every three weeks.  We will check CBC today.

5.  Right shoulder pain.  The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.

6.  Regular healthcare maintenance.  The patient will follow up with me in about two months.

Record date: 2080-01-13

EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.

Forrest.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the

patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's

chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple

medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.  At her

rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent

here.  The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable

for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent

hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the

end of December through the beginning of January.  The patient's

chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the

patient has been doing well at rehab since.  However, today was

noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.  She had

shortness of breath as well.  Her oxygen saturations improved

marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to

nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.  The patient was

treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement

and is noted to be quite tachypneic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,

diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,

anemia, and cervical fracture.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited

by the severity of the patient's presentation.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,

Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,

Colace, and Xalatan.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some

degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and

answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.  Vital signs are as

documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,

and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.  HEENT exam is

atraumatic, normal to inspection.  The patient has a large tongue

and her uvula is not visible at all.  Neck is immobilized in a

C-collar and is obese.  Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath

sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory

use.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without

murmur.  Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.  Abdomen is

soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or

masses, or guarding, or rebound.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry

without any lesions or rash.  Musculoskeletal exam reveals

tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib

fractures.  Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty

speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic

deficit.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.  White

blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is

at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.  LFTs within

normal limit.  INR 1.2.  D-dimer significantly elevated.  EKG

demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which

are present previously but possibly slightly increased.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given

Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was

also started on CPAP.  She seemed to be improving clinically for

some period of time but then began to decline in her mental

status.  At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia. 

Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient

likely needed intubation.  We had hope to hold off to do a

thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines

such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the

procedure.  On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable

throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory

distress.  Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex

her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful

in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in

between those attempts.  For full details of the procedure,

please see the attached procedure note.  Thoracic Surgery was

consulted.  They arrived as the patient was being intubated.  At

this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to

determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural

effusion and whether it is loculated.  This study will be

performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in

the ICU.  A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and

the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural

effusion.

FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.

EDVISIT^10776605^GLENN, OLIVIA^04/15/80^URIBE, HAROLD

Seen by me along with Dr. Oglesby on 04/15/2080.  The history as

documented by Dr. Oglesby was reviewed by me with the patient and

found to be accurate and complete.  The physical exam was

confirmed by my examination.  Evaluation and management was also

concurred with.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is a 66-year-old woman

who enters with recent three-month history of admission for

respiratory failure, pneumonia, and MSSA bacteriemia, discharged

from rehab two weeks ago, presents with two to three day history

of shortness of breath; dyspnea on exertion; PND; orthopnea; and

leg edema, improving, but complains of occasional chest tightness

lasting about an hour, worse with exertion.  No nausea and no

vomiting.  Nonradiating.  Seen by VNA today, blood pressure was

190/100 and sent her here for evaluation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Does not smoke and does not drink.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  History of atrial fibrillation,

hypertension, diabetes, CHF, asthma, and chronic renal

insufficiency, the baseline creatinine is 2.5.

Review of systems, allergies, and medications are as documented

in the chart.  Please see the notes for details.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Awake and alert, well-developed,

well-nourished woman in mild respiratory distress.  Pulse 93,

respirations 18 to 20, blood pressure 158/83, and O2 saturation

100% on 4 liters nasal cannula.  JVP at 10 cm.  Lung exam shows

rales to one-third of the way up to the lung bases. 

Cardiovascularly, regular rate and rhythm.  The rest of the exam

is as documented in the chart other than pedal edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG shows sinus rhythm and left anterior

fascicular hemiblock with flattening at V2.  Chest x-ray shows

pulmonary vascular congestion.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  As such, she was admitted to

Medicine with a diagnosis of decompensated CHF, likely secondary

to hypertension.  Her blood pressure initially when she came in

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DISPOSITION:  She was admitted on 04/15/2080.

Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine

693-31-18-1



I saw Nikkolas Nancy-Jasmine today for evaluation concerning his stroke in August 2091.  The information available today is limited to his knowledge of the events.



He is an 67-year-old Honduran man with a history of diabetes mellitus and HTN.  In August he suffered a stroke.  He reports that his speech was affected and that he developed severe right arm and leg weakness without sensory loss.  He recalls no problem with his vision.  He was hospitalized at Dubuque Obstetrics Gynocology Center.  He does no know the extent of the evaluation.  He was discharged on aspirin to Mitchell County Hospital.  He is now living at home with his wife and son with visiting nurse assistance.  His primary care physician is at Flagler Hospital.  He has severe residual weakness of the right arm and leg.  He also complains of dizziness and an abnormal numbness in his mouth.  The dizziness is worst in the morning.  He also notices a noise in his head when he sleeps.



He has DM and HTN.  He is a nonsmoker.  I don't have cholesterol information.  There is no history of cardiac disease.  There is no history of alcohol abuse.



He is currently taking aspirin, insulin, antihypertensive medication of some type and possibly a cholesterol lowering agent, although he is no sure of this.  He has no known allergies.



He is aware of no significant family history.



He is married.  He lives with his wife and 22-year-old son.  He came to america from Honduras in 2073.  He worked nights in construction until his stroke.



Pulse 66, regular.  BP 186/110.  There are no cranial bruits.  The carotid pulses are full with no bruits.  The lungs are clear.  The heart is regular with no murmur.  The abdomen is benign.  The mental state is normal; he speaks Spanish and broken English.  He is able to name, repeat, and comprehend well.  His fluency in his native language is probably normal.  Cranial nerves are intact.  There is severe weakness of the right arm and leg: right interossei and finger flexors 1/5, finger extensors 0/5, biceps 1/5, triceps 0-1/5, deltoid 0-1/5.  (He tries to raise his arm proximally by elevating the shoulder.)  Right iliopsoas 2/5, quadriceps 2/5, hamstrings 1/5, distally 0/5.  The tone is only mildly increased.  Sensation is intact.  Reflexes are slghtly brisker in the right upper extremity (RUE 2+/4, LUE 2/4, knees 2+/4, ankles 2/4).  The right plantar response is mute; he withdraws the left.  Coordination is intact; weakness inhibits adequate testing on the right.  He wears a right AFO.  He can stand up from his wheelchair and bear weight maneuvering himself to the examining table, but he cannot walk unsupported.



His examination is most consistent with a right equal arm and leg pure motor hemiparesis, sparing the face.  This was likely due to a lacunar infarction in the left basis pontis from small vessel occlusion.  He has major stroke risk factors, including DM, HTN, and probably hypercholesterolemia.  Currently his major needs are to establish good control of his blood pressure and to control other risk factors, including optimtal glucose control and likely medication for hyperlipidemia, and to continue physical and occupational therapy to maximize his functional status.



To review the studies that were done to investigate his stroke in August, I will request the record of that hospitalization from DOGC.  I will also request his records from his physician at the Flagler Hospital.  He will certainly need an adjustment of his antihypertensive regimen.  He tells me that he is planning to see his PCP for this purpose.  I asked him to return here in a month to review this.





Sincerely,







Patrick Winn, M.D.

							Nancy-Jasmine, Nikkolas 
							69331181
							05/24/92 


The patient is a 67-year-old man with hypertension, diabetes, and 
history of recent stroke who comes in for follow up and for 
evaluation of positive PPD.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He was being evaluated for day 
program and in the course of this had a PPD placed which was 
positive.  He has no history of prior TB testing.  He has had no 
chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, fever, chills, weight 
loss or night sweats.  He has had no known exposure to TB.  

He is being treated for hypertension which has been difficult to 
control but seems recently to be doing quite well on a 
combination of HCTZ 12.5mg, metoprolol 50mg b.i.d., Norvasc 10mg 
PO q.d., Zestril 20mg PO q.d.  Today's blood pressure was 
terrific at 128/70.  

He has diabetes and his hemoglobin A1C came down from 10.4 in 
February to 7.9 in May.  He had been started in February on 
Glucophage 500mg PO b.i.d. and seems to e tolerating it quite 
well.  

He did have a stroke in August 2091 with right-sided hemiparesis.  
He is able to walk to the bathroom with a cane but otherwise uses 
a wheelchair.  He had a form for me to complete for a day program 
listing his typical functioning.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is a well-developed, well-nourished, 
pleasant man.  Weight was not done.  Blood pressure 128/70.  
HEENT: throat clear.  Neck supple, no adenopathy or thyromegaly.  
No carotid bruits.  No JVD.  Heart: no murmurs.  Lungs are clear.  
Extremities: no edema.  Neuro: he has weakness in the right leg 
and arm. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1. 	Positive PPD.  At the time of this dictation, his chest x-ray 
came back and is completely normal.  Given his age and unknown 
duration of his positive PPD, will not treat.  
2. 	Hypertension.  Doing well on current combination of 
medications.
3. 	Diabetes, doing much better since he started Glucophage.  At 
his next visit, I will need to confirm when his last eye 
appointment was.  
4. 	Status post CVA.  He seems to be functioning well.

During his May hospitalization he had dysphagia for which he briefly received tube feeds before graduating to POs. He went to Honduras approximately 3 months ago, and ran out of many of his medications in the last 2 weeks, including plavix, lopressor, and metformin. He self-d/c'd zestril for new nausea that he felt was related. Since symptom onset 7 days ago, patient has noted slow improvement in both dysarthria and dysphagia. He continues to note vertigo present sitting, worse standing, and absent supine. He has had difficulty ambulating as well, despite the use of his tripod cane, and his children have helped him at home.

Exam notable for absence of vertigo or nystagmus, as well as retropulsing stance and gait. Hyperglycemia and hypertension may well be exacerbating patient's prior deficits. However, cannot rule out possibility of a subacute infarct in the setting of plavix and antihypertensive discontinuation.

Plan:   

-     Check CTA to assess Circle of Willis

Check MRI brain stroke protocol

Control HTN, goal SBP ~160-180

Control hyperglycemia

If stroke present, admit to Neurology.

R/O MI



Discussed with Dr. Costello.

 

Thank you for this interesting consult.

dyspnea on exertion, no chest pain, no shortness of breath.  He sleeps 
well.  There is no nocturia.  There is no orthopnea or PND.  There is 
currently no claudication.  He does say that he has a history of a left 
femoral/popliteal bypass done in January of 2083, one month after 
arriving from Eritrea.  This was due to chronic left lower extremity 
claudication.  Since then he has had no symptoms of claudication on both 
legs.  He does say that intermittently over the past 3-4 months he has had 
right knee pain mostly after sitting down for a long time.  No 
predominance of the AM right knee pain.  No erythema, no edema.  No 
fevers.  He has no other joint involvement.  He tells me that he has been 
told that he has low-grade diabetes that is being treated with diet, 
although on his presentation to the hospital last year he was found not be 
be diabetic.
 
His past medical history, as mentioned:
 
1.   Status post a left fempop.
2.   Status post right cataract surgery.
3.   History of diabetes.  Diet control in Eritrea.

Smoking:  1 pack/day x 40 years.  He stopped one year ago and now smokes 
intermittently 2-3 cigarettes/day.  He has never had an alcohol abuse 
problem.  He is not a drug consumer.  
 
Physical exam:  He has an appearance that is appropriate to his age.  He 
is a very pleasant man in no acute distress.  His heart rate is 78.  His 
blood pressure is 160/80.  Respiratory rate 16.  His eyes have bilateral 
arcus, no clear-cut central cataract on the right, but on the left there 
is some opacity.  No funduscopic examination was done.  HEENT is 
unremarkable.  Neck exam is supple, nontender.  He has no bruits.  Normal 
thyroid gland.  He has no JVD.  His cardiac exam is regular rate and 
rhythm, no murmurs, no gallops, no rubs, normal S1 and S2.  His lung exam 
is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdominal exam is flat, supple, 
nontender, no organomegaly, normal bowel sounds.  Extremities:  He has 
very faint trace left ankle edema where he has status post fifth digit 
amputation in the past in Eritrea.  There is no evidence of 
hypoperfusion.  There is normal color and normal temperature to the skin.  
There is crepitance upon passive motion of the right knee with no 
erythema, no edema.  His vital extremities are normal.  His pulse is 1+ on 
the right posterior tibialis and nonpalpable on the left.  His popliteals

Assessment and Plan: 
 
1.   Mild systolic hypertension.  At this time I will observe and follow 
     this blood pressure.  I will get a cholesterol level, a renal and a 
     CBC.
 
2.   History of diet-controlled diabetes.  I will obtain glycemia today.  
     He is 8 hours fasting.  
 
3.   Right knee pain.  This is likely due secondary to osteoarthritis.  I 
     am recommending Tylenol for pain.  
 
4.   Peripheral vascular disease.  I am recommending 1 aspirin q.d. for 
     his PVD as well as lowering cardiac risk.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a
76-year-old male who presented to Orlando Regional this
evening for diabetes followup.  He denies any known drug
allergies and at present, he is taking Feratab 300 mg
t.i.d., Motrin 600 mg q.8h. p.r.n., Benadryl 50 mg q.h.s.
p.r.n., Zestril 5 mg q.d., glyburide 2.5 mg q.d., and
aspirin 325 mg q.o.d.  The patient has been followed fairly
frequently in the clinic recently for diabetic foot ulcers
on his right foot, between his 4th and 5th toe.  This
evening, he presents with worsening ulcers in that area and
also a new ulcer between his 3rd and 4th toes.  It has not
improved with good skin care and application of bacitracin;
in fact, it has worsened.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: He denies any bleeding with brushing of
his teeth.  He denies any palpitations or chest pain.  He
denies any shortness of breath or cough.  He denies any
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He states that
his bowel movements have become darkened secondary to his
iron intake.  He denies any symptoms of frequency or
nocturia, no burning, itching, or pain with urination.  He
states that he has occasional elbow pain, which is relieved
with Motrin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 97.8 degrees, his
pulse is 88, his blood pressure is 135/65, weight is 141
pounds, and his random blood sugar is 159.  He states that
he did not take his medication today.  His heart has a
regular rate and rhythm at 88.  Lungs are clear to
auscultation bilaterally.  There are bruises noted on his
right hand and left upper arm, but he states that both of
these were related to trauma.  Examination of his feet
revealed his toes to be more reddened and somewhat shiny,
shinier than previous visits.  They were cool to touch.  On
his right foot, there was a new dime-sized blister on the
4th toe, and the toe that bordered his 3rd toe, and on the
other side.  There was an increase in the size on the toe
ulcer and also on the ulcer on his 5th toe.  Scant amount of
drainage was noted from the toe areas.  Mr. Nicholas Xavier
is vigilant with his foot care and has been so.  This is
definite worsening of his symptoms.  Posterior tibial pulses
are present.

ASSESSMENT
1. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
2. Diabetic foot ulcers on 4th toe, both sides, and 5th toe.

PLAN: Arterial vascular studies with Doppler imaging to be
done.  Referral to surgical clinic for evaluation of his
ulcers.  He was given a prescription for Xeroform gauze to
be used twice daily and dressing changes were explained to
him.  He was instructed to return to clinic in one month for
followup.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Nicholas Xavier is a 73-year-old man who
returns to the Orlando Regional today for a quick follow up on his
left foot ulceration.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Glucovance 5/500 mg b.i.d. and Actos 30 mg
q.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The ulceration has not significantly
changed, but there are no new signs of infection.  He has been
taking Keflex 500 mg t.i.d. for the last seven days.  He denies
fever and his blood glucose levels have started to improve a
little bit.  His fingerstick blood sugar today is 145.

He has an appointment in Vascular Surgery in two days.  I have
asked him that it is extremely important for him to keep that
appointment for the evaluation of this ulceration and his
vascular status.  I have also reviewed with him that he may need
to be hospitalized if a vascular procedure is recommended.

Unfortunately, he does not have an appointment with Podiatry
until the end of this month.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  He will be seen by me again in a few days
after he is seen in Vascular Surgery.  In the meantime, he will
continue with all his medications.  I have given him a
prescription for Zocor 20 mg q.d. since the pharmacy could not
give him Lipitor that I had prescribed.

RE:Nicholas-Xaviar, FredMR #65856594

 

Dear Dr. Vanpelt,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Nicholas-Xavier in follow up after his 

recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. I followed him in the hospital 

when he was admitted in Apr for a left foot ulcer.  As you know, he is a 77 

year-old man from Eritrea with a history of diabetes, hypertension and 

hyperlipidemia, as well as peripheral vascular disease who has had bilateral 

lower extremity bypasses in the past. 

 

He was admitted in Apr of 2091 with a nonhealing left lower extremity ulcer 

for lower extremity redo bypass surgery.  His preoperative evaluation 

included 

a Dobutamine echocardiogram, which revealed a small area of Dobutamine 

induced 

hypokinesis in the inferior wall.  Since this was a small area, it was felt 

he 

could proceed with surgery with moderate risk on a beta-blocker.  He 

underwent 

left lower extremity peripheral bypass surgery and did well postoperative 

with 

no symptoms of chest pain and no change in his EKG.

 

However postoperative enzymes revealed peak CK of 455 with an MB fraction of 

35 and a troponin of 19.5.  As a result of his large troponin leak, he 

underwent cardiac catheterization on Apr 15, 2091 which revealed an 80% left 

main stenosis, 100% totally occluded left anterior descending coronary 

artery, 

100% proximal first diagonal and a 60-70% lesion at the ostium of the 

posterior descending coronary artery with about a 50% lesion in the distal 

PDA. 

 

Postoperative echocardiogram on Apr 13, 2091 revealed an ejection fraction of 

45% with _________ apical hypokinesis and mild mitral insufficiency.  Due to 

his severe left main stenosis, he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 

on 

Apr 20, 2091. He had LIMA to his left anterior descending artery and a vein 

graft to his obtuse marginal artery.  He did not have a graft to his 

posterior 

descending artery since he had a limit to the number of conduits secondary

to his multiple peripheral vascular surgeries.

 

Postoperatively he did quite well and was discharged to rehabilitation on 

April 

27, 2091.  His medications on discharge were aspirin 325mg, Zocor 20mg, 

Subcutaneous Heparin 5000 units b.i.d., Metformin 500mg, Glipizide 10 in the 

morning and 5 in the evening, Captopril 12.5 t.i.d. and Lopressor 25mg q.i.d.

 

Since that time, he has done quite well. He has been progressing at 

rehabilitation to the point that he is now walking ten minutes three times 

per 

day and is working on walking up stairs since he lives on the second floor of 

his house.  He denies any chest pain with walking.  He has no shortness of 

breath or dyspnea on exertion.  He has been sleeping on two pillows for a 

long 

time and this is unchanged.  He denies paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea or 

claudication symptoms with walking at this time.  He does complain of some 

pain in his left shin just below his knee, particularly with palpation. He 

has 

plans to be discharged from rehabilitation in a few days.

On physical examination, his blood pressure is 135/80 with a heart rate of 

60. 

 His jugular venous pressure is flat, and he has good carotid upstrokes 

without carotid bruits.  His lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion 

bilaterally.  His heart has a slight laterally displaced PMI with a regular 

rate and rhythm, normal S1, and S2 and no audible murmur or gallop.  His 

chest 

incision as well as his lower extremity and arm incisions is healing well. He 

has a small scrape on the inner aspect of his left leg, which is also healing 

well.  There is some red discoloration below this lesion that is not warm and 

does not appear to be cellulitic.  His feet are warm.

 

His EKG in my office reveals normal sinus rhythm at 60 with T wave inversions 

in V1 through V5, 1 and L.  They are particularly deep in V2 and V3 but are 

unchanged from his discharge EKG from the hospital.

 

In summary, Mr. Nicholas-Xaviar is a 77 year-old gentleman with diabetes, 

hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular 

disease who is two weeks status post coronary artery bypass grafting and 

three 

weeks left lower extremity bypass who is doing quite well in his recovery.  

He 

will continue with rehabilitation and increase his exercise capacity over 

time. I have reassured him and his granddaughter that he is doing very well 

and that it will take up to two months until he feels back to his baseline. 

 

I have recommended to him and to his rehabilitation facility that he increase 

his Zocor from 20-40mg q.h.s.  I have also changed him to once daily cardiac 

regimen so I have changed his

Captopril to Lisinopril 20mg q.d. and his Lopressor to Toprol XL 100mg p.o. 

q.d..  He will follow up with me in three months time or sooner if he 

develops 

any new symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath or any new cardiac 

concerns.

 

He was seen, examined and discussed with Dr. Steve Franks.  Thank you for 

allowing me to participate in his care.

 

Sincerely,

There are no new symptoms.  He had chest pain and an admission to Colonial Manor several months ago.  There, an adenosine MIBI showed inferior scar and no reversible ischemia.  Cardiac function was 67%.  There was diffuse contraction thickening of the walls.



Diabetes mellitus

The patient remains on metformin, and hemoglobin A1c will be rechecked.



Hypertension

The patient remains on a complex regimen with the assistance of the Renal Service.  He remains on hydralazine, atenolol, Cozaar, and Norvasc.  His blood pressure has been stable by his report, and we get 150/80, repeated by me 150/70 today.  

A: Metastable hypertension. 

P: Follow up Renal Service and check BUN and creatinine today.



Renal failure

Has proteinuria and a creatinine approaching 3.  I have asked him to reschedule a followup with the Renal Service.
